# God of War Ukrainian Localization
Welcome to the God of War Ukrainian Localization project! We are a team of four dedicated individuals working to bring a high-quality Ukrainian translation to the critically acclaimed game, God of War.

## Project Overview
Our goal is to translate the game's text and dialogue into Ukrainian, preserving the original tone and emotional impact. By doing so, we aim to make this incredible game accessible to Ukrainian-speaking gamers and enrich their gaming experience.

## Why This Project Matters
**Accessibility:** Making God of War available in Ukrainian will allow more players to enjoy the game's rich narrative and immersive world.
**Cultural Representation:** This project promotes cultural diversity and inclusivity within the gaming community.< br / >**Community-Driven:** We are an independent group passionate about gaming and localization, driven by our love for both the game and our native language.
