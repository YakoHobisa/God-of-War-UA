Mother gave me this journal and made me promise to use it. So… I guess I just write everything down now? Should be plenty of time while Father chops down the trees she marked. Been a long while since I’ve gone anywhere with him… but this is what she wanted, so I guess we both better get used to it.<br />
*674*<br />
Hunt with Atreus<br />
*675*<br />
Father’s taking me hunting before we start the journey to the mountain. Mother’s wishes were clear—we let the pyre burn, then take her ashes to the highest peak in the realms. I’ve got to show him I’m ready and I won’t get sick anymore. Mom wanted us to scatter them together… I won’t let her down!<br />
*676*<br />
Find the Deer<br />
*677*<br />
Can’t let that deer get away, time to finish what we started.<br />
*678*<br />
Return to the house<br />
*679*<br />
Wow, Father and I killed a troll. I always knew he was tough, but I never knew he could move like that. Time to head home to recover.<br />
*680*<br />
Continue towards the mountain<br />
*681*<br />
Father and I have left home and are going to the highest peak in the realm to spread mothers ashes.<br />
*682*<br />
Escape the ruins<br />
*683*<br />
Father beat the stranger at our door, but we’re not safe there anymore. Ready or not, we’re heading for the mountain. \n<br />
First we need to escape this creepy place. Where are all the people?<br />
*684*<br />
Continue towards the mountain<br />
*685*<br />
We survived the monsters and traps that were in the ruins and found the mountain again. Now we are back on the path.<br />
*686*<br />
Hunt with Atreus<br />
*687*<br />
On another hunt. I think Father is trying to take my mind off of what happened before. I won’t let him down.<br />
*688*<br />
Find Atreus<br />
*689*<br />
Tracking the boar, I got separated from Father. How’d that happen? I’m always the one trying to keep up.<br />
*690*<br />
Follow the Witch<br />
*691*<br />
I shot the boar, but it was a friendly magic boar and this nice Witch’s friend! We need to help her save his life…<br />
*692*<br />
Collect the white-petaled flower<br />
*693*<br />
The Witch sent me to the garden out back to gather herbs for the boar. I hope she can heal him.<br />
*694*<br />
Return to Atreus<br />
*695*<br />
We did everything we could for the Boar. When Father is done talking to the Witch, it’ll be time to get back to our journey.<br />
*696*<br />
Return to the Witch<br />
*697*<br />
Time to bid farewell to the Witch and get back on the path… but I can’t believe I dropped Mother’s knife.<br />
*698*<br />
Get to the boat<br />
*699*<br />
The nice Witch drew protection staves on us and showed us a way to reach the mountain by boat. Row towards daylight, she said…<br />
*700*<br />
Boat towards daylight<br />
*701*<br />
Is every witch’s cave full of monsters and treasure chests? I don’t know any other witches, so I guess that’s not weird. Anyways, we found the boat, so we should head towards daylight.<br />
*702*<br />
Follow the Witch<br />
*703*<br />
The Black Breath—some sort of nasty-smelling magic—stopped us at the entrance to the mountain. The friendly Witch from the woods appeared and told us we need the Light of Alfheim, and she’s going to help us get it…<br />
*704*<br />
Realign the bridge<br />
*705*<br />
To get the light we need to dispel the Black Breath, we need to go to Alfheim. To get to Alfheim, we need to realign the bridge so we can use the Realm Travel Room.<br />
*706*<br />
Follow the Witch<br />
*707*<br />
We realigned the bridge and I think we are all set to continue our journey. I’m glad we have the Witch of the Woods here to help.<br />
*708*<br />
Travel to Alfheim<br />
*709*<br />
I’ve heard stories about Alfheim and the Light Elves from Mother, but I never thought I’d actually get to go there myself. Our goal is to find The Light and dispel the Black Breath, but I can’t wait to see what going to another realm is like.<br />
*710*<br />
The Light of Alfheim<br />
*711*<br />
Capture the Light of Alfheim and dispel the Black Breath to reach the mountain.<br />
*712*<br />
Get to the Ringed Temple<br />
*713*<br />
The Light Elves and Dark Elves are fighting an endless war over the light we need. Father doesn’t want to get involved, but we need some of the Bifröst light for ourselves if we’re ever going to fulfill Mom’s final wish. They cut off the light bridge to the temple, so we’re finding another way in.<br />
*714*<br />
Free the boat<br />
*715*<br />
We ran into our pal Sindri along the beach and also found this boat tangled up in hive tendrils. If we find a way to dislodge it, we can explore further into Alfheim<br />
*716*<br />
Between The Realms<br />
*717*<br />
What lies off the path of the World Tree?<br />
*718*<br />
Find a way into the temple<br />
*719*<br />
The Light Elves and Dark Elves are fighting an endless war over the light we need. Father doesn’t want to get involved, but we need some of the Bifröst light for ourselves if we’re ever going to fulfill Mom’s final wish. The Elves are trying to keep us out, but we’re looking for a way in.<br />
*720*<br />
Reactivate the Ringed Temple bridge<br />
*721*<br />
We found a light bridge leading into the temple, but as soon as we got close it went out. There has to be a way to reactivate it, time to start looking for clues.<br />
*722*<br />
Go back up to the Ringed Temple bridge<br />
*723*<br />
We reactivated the main bridge. Now all we have to do is get back up and cross it. Should be easy, right?<br />
*724*<br />
Find another way into the temple<br />
*725*<br />
Well, the front door was locked. Guess I should have seen that coming. Time to look for another way into the Temple.<br />
*726*<br />
Find a way into the hive<br />
*727*<br />
We’re in the temple where they keep the Light of Alfheim, but it’s all covered up. We need to find a way to free it so we can get what we need for the Bifröst.<br />
*728*<br />
Destroy the hive and claim the Light<br />
*729*<br />
So, yea, of course we need to bring this hive down. Things sure seem dire in Alfheim these days. We need the light and the only way we are going to get it is by destroying this hive. Maybe we’ll end up helping the Light Elves in the process.<br />
*730*<br />
Find a way out of the temple<br />
*731*<br />
We have the Light. Let’s get out of this place.<br />
*732*<br />
Return to the boat<br />
*733*<br />
The Light Elves have returned to Alfheim! I know that this wasn’t our original goal, but I feel pretty good about it. Now, we need to find a way back to our boat which is on the other side of the lake. We’ll have to go through the trench to get there.<br />
*734*<br />
Return to Týr’s Temple<br />
*735*<br />
Now that we have the Light of Alfheim captured in the Bifröst, we can return to Midgard and continue our journey to the highest peak.<br />
*736*<br />
Realm travel back to Midgard<br />
*737*<br />
Wow… what a trip. We destroyed the Dark Elf Hive, ended the war, Father disappeared into the Light for what seemed like forever and I had to fight off an entire swarm of Dark Elves. So much has happened since Mom died… but we can’t lose sight of our goal to spread her ashes. Time to head back to Midgard and use the Light on the Black Breath.<br />
*738*<br />
Investigate the dead Giant<br />
*739*<br />
Our journey continues! Step one: get a piece of the chisel from the dead Giant’s hammer.<br />
*740*<br />
Retrieve a piece of the chisel<br />
*741*<br />
We’re here and its cold. The Giant is huge, so it should be easy enough to make our way over there and get a piece of his hammer… although by this point, I know that nothing is as easy as it seems.<br />
*742*<br />
Find a way to break the ice<br />
*743*<br />
The magic chisel we need a piece of is buried under a lot of ice (and a dead Giant stone mason). Father’s got a plan to reach it. I hope it works!<br />
*744*<br />
Retrieve a piece of the chisel<br />
*745*<br />
That chisel is huge, so we’ll have to carve a little piece off of it to take with us.<br />
*746*<br />
Return to the boat<br />
*747*<br />
We got to the chisel’s tip, but Thor’s awful sons Magni and Modi attacked us. Father put his axe through Magni’s face and Modi ran away, but I got so angry I almost got sick again. I must fight it! We just need the travel rune to Jötunheim now, and we can finally scatter Mom’s ashes…<br />
*748*<br />
Find a way out of Helheim<br />
*749*<br />
I’ve really messed everything up. I killed Modi for what he said about Mom, but Father got angry and we kept arguing all the way to the summit. Then Baldur found us, and in the fighting we destroyed our path to Jötunheim. Now we’ve been sucked into the far side of Hel, and somehow we need to get out of here before we freeze.<br />
*750*<br />
Use the ship<br />
*751*<br />
Maybe this ship is my ticket out of Helheim.<br />
*752*<br />
Free the Ship<br />
*753*<br />
Going to need to free the ship if I want to make it out of here<br />
*754*<br />
Escape Helheim<br />
*755*<br />
The boat works just like those flying lanterns in the mountain! If we can free it, and keep it in one piece, maybe we can sail out of Hel alive! \n<br />
Also—Freya is Baldur’s mother!?<br />
*756*<br />
Return to Týr’s Vault<br />
*757*<br />
Father told me…. he’s a god, and so am I. I guess not knowing was making me sick. He seems so ashamed, I guess because of how much he hates gods… but Mom always said some of them were good. Anyway—back to Týr’s vault to find the Black Rune!<br />
*758*<br />
Go to Týr’s Vault<br />
*759*<br />
Of course Týr wouldn’t just leave the Black Rune sitting out. I know it’s a vault, but this thing has some serious security.<br />
*760*<br />
Escape the trap<br />
*761*<br />
Well this isn’t good…<br />
*762*<br />
Show Týr’s key plans to Brok<br />
*763*<br />
These plans seem to lay out how to create a special key.<br />
*764*<br />
Locate Týr’s mysterious door<br />
*765*<br />
Brok and Sindri made us the key to enter Týr’s hidden chamber. I have a feeling it’s that door downstairs by the water, on the round part of the temple. If it was important enough for Týr to hide, maybe there’s something inside that can give us a new path to Jötunheim!<br />
*766*<br />
Go back up and flip the temple<br />
*767*<br />
Let’s flip this temple!<br />
*769*<br />
It has to be down here somewhere.<br />
*897*<br />
Enter the Völunder Mines<br />
*898*<br />
Brok just asked us to find his Alchemist friend, Andvari, at the Völunder Mines. Father isn’t big on helping people for no reward, but Brok DID just give us the entry stone to the Mines… Maybe we should look into it?<br />
*899*<br />
Find the Dwarf with a green ring<br />
*900*<br />
Brok isn’t sure his friend is still alive, but at least we know he’s wearing a green ring. I’ll keep an eye out for it while Father is “gathering resources.”<br />
*903*<br />
Retrieve the severed hand<br />
*904*<br />
We killed the Soul Eater and found Andvari’s ring! And his hand. But… no body. We should look at the ring and make sure it’s Andvari’s.<br />
*907*<br />
Return to Brok<br />
*908*<br />
I hope Brok isn’t too upset about Andvari being dead. I’m not sure exactly what he needed him for, but maybe he’ll give us a reward for finding the ring?<br />
*909*<br />
Deus Ex Malachite<br />
*910*<br />
Help Brok find his dead friend Andvari<br />
*911*<br />
Meet Brok at the Landsuther Mines<br />
*912*<br />
Brok thinks he knows where we might find his dead friend Andvari (the Dwarf whose hand we found). He’ll explain more if we meet him at the Landsuther Mines.<br />
*913*<br />
Search for Andvari’s hammer<br />
*914*<br />
So, that ring we found: Andvari’s soul is trapped inside! Apparently, he stashed it in there so the Soul Eater wouldn’t eat it. Brok wants us to use him to find his fancy hammer. Andvari seems grouchy about it, but I guess I would be too if I were trapped in a ring and some strangers were stealing my stuff.<br />
*915*<br />
Return to Brok<br />
*916*<br />
With Andvari’s help (finally), we found his hammer! For a soul trapped in a ring, Andvari sure is talkative. I bet Brok will be happy to have them both!<br />
*917*<br />
Fáfnir’s Hoard<br />
*918*<br />
Help Sindri find Fáfnir’s whetstone<br />
*919*<br />
Head to Fáfnir’s storeroom<br />
*920*<br />
Sindri told us about the Dwarf Fáfnir who was renowned for his collection of (stolen) treasures. A treasure-filled storeroom sounds like it might be worth a look. Sindri asked us to keep an eye out for a special whetstone from Niflheim. I just hope nobody got there before us…<br />
*921*<br />
Use entry stone on the pedestal<br />
*922*<br />
We made it inside the Storeroom, but all the rooms are locked. Seems like Fáfnir was pretty paranoid about people stealing his stuff. Although I guess since WE’RE here to steal his stuff, he had reason to be. Hopefully Sindri’s entry stone will unlock the first room.<br />
*923*<br />
Search for the whetstone<br />
*924*<br />
The first room is open! Maybe we’ll find another entry stone inside. We should search every room in here for Sindri’s whetstone… and anything else that looks useful. Hopefully the Reavers didn’t pick this place clean.<br />
*925*<br />
Talk to the Reaver Spirit<br />
*926*<br />
We’re in the last room, and we haven’t found a whetstone yet. But there’s a spirit here. Maybe he knows something?<br />
*927*<br />
Return to Sindri<br />
*928*<br />
When he was alive, the Reaver Spirit found the whetstone we were looking for… and then his son stabbed him in the back and took it! Father took the dagger from his back, and now we’re bringing it back to Sindri. Maybe he’ll be able to use it to find his whetstone.<br />
*929*<br />
Family Business<br />
*930*<br />
Retrieve the whetstone.<br />
*931*<br />
Head to the Northri Stronghold<br />
*932*<br />
Sindri used the sigil on the knife we brought him to trace the Reavers to the Northri Stronghold. That’s probably where they brought their haul from the storeroom, including that whetstone he keeps going on about. We should check it out and see what we can find.<br />
*933*<br />
Find a way to open the grate<br />
*934*<br />
Looks like these Reavers were just as paranoid as Fáfnir. There’s a giant metal grate blocking our path. Maybe we can open it using the giant water wheel?<br />
*935*<br />
Explore deeper into the stronghold<br />
*936*<br />
What was this place? We haven’t found much so far besides corrupted Reavers. We should go deeper into the stronghold.<br />
*937*<br />
Investigate the reaver ship<br />
*938*<br />
We found a wrecked Reaver ship, and it looks like things didn’t end well for them. We should get down there and take a closer look.<br />
*939*<br />
Return to Sindri<br />
*940*<br />
I can’t stop thinking about how this Reaver killed his own father. Why are people so greedy sometimes? At least we found the whetstone Sindri wanted! I wonder what he’ll make us with it… once he finishes cleaning the blood off…<br />
*941*<br />
CUT - Inform the Brother of His Own Death<br />
*942*<br />
The Fallen Warrior said we could find his brother near Lookout Tower<br />
*943*<br />
Return to the Fallen Warrior<br />
*944*<br />
We found the brother and told him he was dead… it went poorly. Time to return to the Fallen Warrior.<br />
*945*<br />
The Anatomy of Hope<br />
*946*<br />
Maybe we can talk to Mom again…<br />
*947*<br />
Recover Gullveig’s Bones<br />
*948*<br />
Bones Collected: %d of %d \n<br />
This ghost wants us to find this dead lady’s bones and bring them back to the rest of her body. She’s missing both hands and her head. It’s pretty disgusting! But if it works, maybe it’ll be worth it…<br />
*949*<br />
Return Gullveig’s Bones<br />
*950*<br />
We have all the bones, now we just need to place them with the skeletal corpse next to the spirit guy’s body and see what happens. I wonder what this maiden is like… and why they scattered her body parts.<br />
*951*<br />
Speak to the spirit<br />
*952*<br />
We’ve recovered all the scattered bones of the maiden. Time to bring them back to the spirit and see if he can make good on his word.<br />
*953*<br />
Kill Gullveig<br />
*954*<br />
Father was right—<br />
*955*<br />
Hammer Fall<br />
*956*<br />
Bring down the smaller Thor statue on the island off Veithurgard<br />
*957*<br />
Destroy the statue of Thor<br />
*958*<br />
We met the ghost of a man who devoted his life to Thor, but now he’s turned against him. He wants us to destroy a statue… not the big one in the Lake of Nine, but a smaller one on an island outside the lake, adorned in emerald. As much as Father hates gods, I bet we’ll help him out.<br />
*959*<br />
Return to the Disciple of Thor<br />
*960*<br />
Now that we brought down the statue we should probably head back to that spirit and let him know. I also have to remind Father that we were allowed to loot the grave near the statue.<br />
*961*<br />
Elven Artifacts Collected: %d of %d<br />

The Jötunheim travel gate is missing its crystal.<br />
*3568*<br />
Talk to Brok and Sindri<br />
*3569*<br />
The trip to Jötunheim failed because we don’t have a travel crystal. We could use Mimir’s eyes if he only had them both, but Odin ran off with one. We’re going to see what Brok and Sindri know about it…<br />
*3571*<br />
Return to the Serpent’s horn in Midgard<br />
*3572*<br />
We need Mimir’s eye to travel to Jötunheim. Odin stole his eye and hid it in the statue of Thor. Jörmungandr the World Serpent ate the statue. So, I guess we have to ask the Serpent if we can have it back…?<br />
*3573*<br />

Ascend the mountain<br />
*3700*<br />
We made it inside the mountain! Now we need to find a way up to the highest peak, where Mom wanted her ashes scattered.<br />
*3701*<br />
Use the sand bowl lift<br />
*3702*<br />
Traverse the dark caves<br />
*3703*<br />
We dispelled the Black Breath with the Light from Alfheim. Now we need to find a way up to the highest peak, where Mom wanted her ashes scattered.<br />
*3704*<br />
Ascend the Cave Shaft<br />
*3705*<br />
There is a huge cave shaft inside the mountain, there’s got to be a way for us to get up there.<br />
*3706*<br />
Reach the summit<br />
*3707*<br />
Well that’s one way to go up. Thankfully there is a huge working lift that should take us the rest of the way to the top. Hopefully it’s sturdy.<br />

*3712*<br />
Found a lift that should take us to the boat. Just have to solve this Runebowl puzzle. Thankfully, we’ve done a couple of these before, so it should be a piece of cake.<br />
*3713*<br />
Return to the mountain<br />
*3714*<br />
We’re back in Midgard. Feels like we’ve been gone forever. The mountain is in sight, we have what we need, let’s get back to it.<br />
*3715*<br />
Dispel the Black Breath<br />
*3716*<br />
Our whole trip to Alfheim started when we encountered the Black Breath at Peak’s Pass. Now that we have the Alfheim Light, we can dispel it and start ascending the mountain.<br />
*3717*<br />
A New Destination<br />
*3718*<br />
The true highest peak is in Jötunheim, and Mimir’s going to help us get there.<br />
*3719*<br />
Take Mimir’s head to the Witch<br />
*3720*<br />
There’s a lot happening! At the summit we met Mimir, who made us cut off his head, and said if we can bring him back to life he’ll help us get to Jötunheim. Oh, and apparently GODS are looking for us—Baldur of Asgard and his nephews, the Sons of Thor! I’m so confused. But now we’re heading back to the Witch to see if her magic can wake up Mimir’s head.<br />

*9852*<br />
We found the Dwarf King Mótsognir dead in his Stronghold. He was trying to craft the armor too, he just didn’t know that the final ingredient was his own ultimate sacrifice. Father says “his loss is our gain,” so now all we have to do is take these three ingredients to Brok and Sindri. They’re hard to describe… but I’m sure the brothers can figure out what to do with them.<br />

Mother always said Týr was among the most beloved of the gods. Mortals would sail from all over the world to visit his temple and bring him offerings.

These offerings are really nice, I bet Brok or his brother could turn them into something useful like armor.<br />

Travelers are some of the most powerful and well armored enemies we’ve fought on our journey. The last one we fought left behind a shard of their armor. I would bet Brok or Sindri could use this to craft an armor set for us. In fact, I bet they could build one that’s even stronger than the armor the Travelers themselves wear.<br />

Bring the Ancient’s Heart to Brok or Sindri<br />
*11980*<br />
After our battle with the Ancient, its heart remained. Someone might mistake it for just a chunk of rock, but it pulses with magic. Father and I should bring this to Brok or Sindri. Something this hard and powerful is sure to be a useful ingredient in an armor crafting recipe.<br />

Dragon Shrines Destroyed: %d of %d \n<br />
I had heard whispers of a Dwarf King who was capturing dragons. I didn’t think it was possible until we found one chained by three magic shrines. I know they can be dangerous, but it just feels so wrong to keep them chained up. The three shrines in the area are what is keeping Otr in captivity. We’ll have to avoid him and break those shrines if we want to set him free.<br />

The dragon Reginn, brother of Fáfnir and Otr. He’s bound by these magic chains, but we should be able to free him if we break the three shrines. The stories say Reginn was once a Dwarf and a great blacksmith. Too bad he can’t craft us some armor.<br />

Fáfnir… I’ve heard the name before. Son of a Dwarf King, guardian of his treasure, cursed by Andvari. If we want to free him, we’ll have to break the three shrines that bind him. I know dragons are dangerous, but it seems like Fáfnir has been through a lot.<br />

We found a scroll written by the son of the spirit who was stabbed in his back. His son actually felt really bad about what he did, and it ended up costing him his life. That spirit was still stuck in this realm, maybe we should go tell him about this and see if he can find some peace.<br />

It was no accident Mom sent us to Jötunheim. She knew everything that was going to happen… everything that HAD to happen. Mother was a Giant.  The last “guardian” in Midgard. I guess she couldn’t tell us… but now she wanted us to know. She wanted me to see I have a destiny, but I’m not really sure what it all means yet. Maybe we’ll head home now, or maybe we’ll see who else needs our help. I’m ready for whatever is next.<br />

But that’s a worry for another day. For now I’ll keep training, and learning from Father…. and he wants to go back out and help more people now! I think he’s still learning, too.

*20031*<br />
Complete<br />
*20052*<br />
A mighty Giant made of frost and stone. Looks like he had a huge fight with Aesir and Vanir gods. He battles Thor… and it looks like they both lose.<br />
*20053*<br />
“Hrungnir the Brawler”—a head of stone, but the mind of a child. Odin tricks him into getting drunk and rowdy in Asgard. Thor smashes his head, but he ends up crushed, and everybody laughs. Aesir are the worst.<br />
*20054*<br />
This one’s confusing. Ymir’s the first Giant, and things spring from his body… not just other Giants, but wind, trees, sun… maggots that turn into Dwarves maybe? Then Odin kills him… but where did he come from?<br />
*20055*<br />
So Ymir came from fire and ice, and all lands and creatures came from his flesh… including the Aesir, who then slew him to create “order” (in other words, to take control). The first Giant was Odin’s first victim…<br />
*20056*<br />
Hrungnir<br />
*20083*<br />
Ymir<br />
*20084*<br />
Thamur<br />
*20085*<br />
The greatest stone mason and one of the biggest Giants of all. He argues with his son Hrimthur, strikes him, and gets lost looking for him. Thor chisels Thamur in the head and crushes a whole town!<br />
*20086*<br />
Thamur was building a wall around Jötunheim to protect Giants from the Aesir. Did it ever get finished?<br />
*20087*<br />
Wolf-Giants! Sköll chases the Sun and Hati the Moon. What happens when they catch their prey? Looks like a massive fight—Odin, Thor, the World Serpent… could it be…?<br />
*20088*<br />
Sköll and Hati<br />
*20089*<br />
Ragnarök! Odin knows the prophecy and sent them anyway, cause Mimir says he’s always trying to control everything. Until then, they’re the “Bringers of Day and Night” that keep the Sun and Moon moving.<br />
*20090*<br />
A legendary Giant huntress—one of Mother’s favorites. She could hunt birds, boars, deer, anything! Her father taught her how… but what happened to him…?<br />
*20091*<br />
Skaði<br />
*20092*<br />
Her father Thiazi could take the form of any creature. Odin got jealous and tricked Skaði into hunting an eagle that was Thiazi in disguise! Is she still out there somewhere, under the frozen mountains?<br />
*20093*<br />
Bergelmir<br />
*20094*<br />
A Giant King with many, MANY children. Looks like he arrived on a sea of blood, and when he died he left a sea of tears. Dead, but not murdered (for once).<br />
*20095*<br />
Bergelmir and his queen survived the flood of Ymir’s blood, and founded Jötunheim. They did NOT seek revenge, except to live and see his kind prosper. “Bergelmir the Beloved”—a happy ending!<br />
*20096*<br />
Gróa<br />
*20097*<br />
A Giant Sorceress, and a powerful seer. Slain by Odin… did he steal her book of visions?<br />
*20098*<br />
Called “The Knowledge Keeper”, Gróa was the first to have a vision of Ragnarök. She trusted Odin as a friend. BAD IDEA.<br />
*20099*<br />
Jörmungandr<br />
*20100*<br />
The World Serpent spans all the waters of Midgard… maybe the only one big enough to beat Thor? I still can’t believe we met him!<br />
*20101*<br />
Now that I’ve heard Mimir talk to Jörmungandr in his ancient tongue, I wonder if I could figure out how to do it…<br />
*20102*<br />
Odin plotted to destroy Starkaðr after hearing Mimir praise him as a potential leader of Giants. They spread rumors and gathered a mob, and when he surrendered to clear his name, Thor murdered him.<br />
*20103*<br />
A Giant with eight arms, swinging four swords… until Thor chopped him up. Why did the gods gang up on him?<br />
*20104*<br />
Starkaðr<br />
*20105*<br />
Surtr<br />
*20106*<br />
An ancient Fire Giant of Muspelheim. He forged a sword of fire, and fought—or will fight—Thor and Odin.<br />
*20107*<br />
Prophecy says “Surtr the Brave” will die at Ragnarök but take Asgard with him. Mimir says it’s part of a grand cycle of death and rebirth, and Surtr accepts his fate.<br />

*21391*<br />
Defeat Baldur<br />
*21392*<br />
We got Mimir’s eye back, but Baldur attacked Jörmungandr and he spat us out near the dead Stone Mason. Now Freya’s here and Baldur’s in a rage and everyone’s having it out. I don’t think we’re all walking away from this…<br />
*21393*<br />
Return to the Realm Travel Room<br />
*21394*<br />
Return to Sindri<br />
*21395*<br />
It’s over now. The spell on Baldur was broken by the mistletoe arrow holding up my quiver (of all things)! Freya brought back Thamur the Stone Mason to stop us, but Jörmungandr helped us beat him. We beat Baldur together, and we would have let him go, but he tried to kill Freya… and I guess she was alright with that, but we weren’t. Now he’s dead, and she’s really angry, and I don’t know how to feel about any of it. But one thing’s for sure: we’re going to Jötunheim!<br />
*21396*<br />
We sealed the three realm tears in Niflheim, and boy, it was not easy. I don’t think Sindri will believe us, but I can’t wait to tell him.<br />
*21397*<br />

“From darkness keep safe the Light”\n\nMore like trying to keep the other Elves from getting it…<br />
*25609*<br />
“Until gods grow good”\n\nI guess he means never. But maybe…<br />
*25610*<br />
“Leave them in peace”\n\nA message from Týr? Does he mean the Giants?<br />
*25640*<br />
“Duraþrór”\n\nA stag of the World Tree who watches the gates of Jötunheim (where Giants come from). This really IS the Giants’ mountain!<br />
*25641*<br />
“Ignite”\n\nI was able to light this “Brazier” by reading the runes. Some kind of spell, maybe? I bet there are more of these around the Lake of Nine. Were there more people here, before this was a lake? Where did they all go? So many questions… I wish we could ask the World Serpent!<br />
*25642*<br />
“To Njörd we offer back the sea’s bounty.”\n\nFor a god, Njörd doesn’t sound too bad.<br />
*25643*<br />
“Death Inside”\n\nThis must be old. There’s plenty of death outside, too.<br />
*25644*<br />
“Hræzlyr”\n\nWho or what would be named “terror”…?<br />
*25645*<br />
“Muspelheim”\n”Gauntlet of Surtr”\n\nThe ancient realm of fire! Now that we have the travel rune, we can go anytime and see what new challenges await.<br />
*25647*<br />
“Thought is faster than wind”\n\nTýr’s testing our minds in here…<br />
*25652*<br />
“Hunting Death”\n\nHmm… Does this mean someone died during a hunt, or they were LITERALLY hunting Death? Sounds rough either way.<br />
*25654*<br />
“Don’t wake him”\n\nI’m REALLY getting tired of being told what to do.<br />
*25662*<br />
“Njörd was here”\n\nTrying to imagine Mimir drinking with a Vanir god. Actually not that hard. I wonder if Freya was ever here…<br />
*25663*<br />
“Trade Grounds”\n\nFound what used to be a marketplace where gods and Giants would meet and trade. Must have been before the war…<br />
*25699*<br />
“Death to the Raven God, Lord of the Hanged”\n\nShe really doesn’t like Odin very much.<br />
*25704*<br />
“Welcome Jötnar”\n\nThe Jötnar had a settlement here? Giants, so close to home! But… how long ago?<br />
*25707*<br />
“Turn back, Aesir”\n\nI hope those are magic runes… words won’t keep the Aesir away.<br />
*25708*<br />
I guess Ymir lived a long time ago. Wonder what happened to them…<br />
*25709*<br />
“Jötnar only<br />
and also Dwarves”\n\nThe Mountain was a stronghold of the Giants in Midgard. After they left, the Dwarves mined it dry.<br />
*25710*<br />
“The eternal war for the Light endures”\n\nThe same Light we need for the Bifröst, of course.<br />
*25715*<br />
“Niflheim”\n”Fog and Fortune”\n\nA misty realm of treasure and traps! Well, we have the rune to go explore…<br />
*25716*<br />
“Seiðr níðings upon all who trespass”\n\n…but we’re invited here… right?<br />

“Through this path lies the Mines of Völunder. This great endeavor was made possible by Andvari the Alchemist, Son of Ivaldi, through whose ingenuity the very stone and bedrock was turned from obstacle to mighty tool of industry. A Dwarven Miner’s greatest fear has always been running afoul of The Ancients, but through Andvari’s genius, they are now no more than tools in our righteous undertaking. A new age for Dwarves dawns here—no mere miners but masters of iron, whose greatest craft is the future itself!”<br />
*31132*<br />
To See Her Again<br />
*31156*<br />
“The death of my daughter turned me into a broken man, but one of the Lake Spirits tells me I can find some peace. His master’s a powerful seiðr witch, and he says she’ll reunite me with my sweet Iona! I just need to find her bones. Don’t know why someone would go to the trouble a scatterin’ bones across the Lake of Nine, but the task is naught to me. I’d go to Helheim for a chance to see my daughter again.”<br />
*31162*<br />
Death to the Gods<br />
*31163*<br />
“I was foolish to think a simple apprentice could survive on his own out in these harsh lands. My supplies dwindle, and the Draugr are more numerous than I had anticipated. But my parents deserve vengeance, and I will not rest until they have it. They only wanted to honor the gods, and died with nothing to show for it. The gods… they are not wise. They are not just or good. They are not to be worshiped or idolized. They are no better than man. I pray for their deaths.<br />
I realize the irony. Who am I praying to? What god answers the prayer of ’death to the gods’? And still, I pray for one who would purify this world of their evil and send them to the same Hel that awaits the rest of us.”<br />
*31164*<br />
Shipwrecked<br />
*31643*<br />
“Until today, I’ve always thought the Lake of Nine as a desolate, cursed place. And for the three ships caught in the recent storm, that notion holds true. But for this simple scavenger? Their loss is my gain. I found their fool of a captain on one of the beaches. He was a broken man, in both spirit and body.  I gave him Hel’s kindness, but not before I filled my pockets with all the Hacksilver I could carry.<br />
The captain held an Offering to Týr, which is all well and good… But to neglect Thor? What kind of experienced seafarer neglects the God of Thunder?”<br />

“With each passing day, the dead continue to rise. Their resurrection occurs in various forms. Draugr, once merely an occasional sighting, have spread in shocking numbers across Midgard and beyond. The icy bodies of re-animated Reavers (commonly known as ‘Hel-Walkers’) remain a mystery—what causes their resurrection? Finally, the various spirits throughout the Lake of Nine. They appear harmless… which is more than can be said of the Draugr and Hel-Walkers. The ones I’ve encountered show a single-minded determination in some task or desire that keeps them bound to this realm. What will happen to them should they achieve their goal? All have offered some form of reward. Speaking with these spirits can be unsettling, but perhaps their requests bear further consideration?”<br />

Draugr<br />
*34931*<br />
Mother said that Draugr were warriors who died, but their souls were too stubborn and angry to stop fighting. They’d fight off the Valkyrie that came to collect them, and bring their own dead bodies back to life… warping and twisting their previous form into something else. Now they’re husks of their former selves, and fight anybody they can find. She also said they can come back in all different shapes and sizes and that some even have powers that others may not.<br />
*34932*<br />
Heavy Draugr<br />
*34933*<br />
These Draugr seem bigger than the ones we first encountered. They carry heavier, more dangerous weapons. It makes them slower, but they’re a LOT stronger than the regular ones.<br />
*34934*<br />
Draugr (Shield)<br />
*34935*<br />
I already knew that Draugr weren’t just mindless monsters, but I didn’t think they were smart enough to use a shield. They like using it, too. We’ll have to change up our strategy a bit and see where we can find an opening.<br />
*34936*<br />
Draugr (Dual Wield)<br />
*34937*<br />
A Draugr with two weapons is twice as dangerous, right? When they’re with a more defensive enemy, we should consider taking down these dual-wielding Draugr early in the fight and not turn our back on them.<br />
*34938*<br />
Draugr (Projectile)<br />
*34939*<br />
These Draugr can shoot fireballs. How do they do that? They like to attack from a distance, which can be really annoying when we’re fighting a bunch of other enemies, but luckily they go down pretty quickly.<br />
*34940*<br />
Draugr (Speed)<br />
*34941*<br />
What’s more terrifying than a Draugr? A Draugr that can run at you really fast. Mother said some Draugr had special powers, and these ones are able to shoot fire out of their legs and move quickly around the battlefield. We’ll need to be on our toes.<br />
*34942*<br />
Draugr (Explosive)<br />
*34943*<br />
I’m not sure how they do it, but these Draugr store energy in their bodies, and then explode on contact. But the explosion doesn’t hurt them at all! I wonder if it feels good to them? Anyways, we should attack from a distance when we see that they are fully charged up.<br />
*34944*<br />
Draugr (Power Weapon)<br />
*34945*<br />
As if the undead trying to kill us with sharp objects wasn’t bad enough, some Draugr can channel energy through their arms, charging their weapons and making them even more dangerous. Getting hit with a rusty old sword hurts, but getting hit with a fire-charged sword hurts worse.<br />
*34946*<br />
It takes a beat for him to recover after swinging, if we dodge, he’ll be open to a counter-attack.<br />
*34947*<br />
His attacks are so strong, it makes blocking them really hard. Father should probably just dodge them.<br />
*34948*<br />
Swinging wildly won’t break his guard, but if Father uses his Block Break, he should be able to find an opening (Double Tap [BlockButton]).<br />
*34949*<br />
Parrying his attacks can also break his guard.<br />
*34950*<br />
These Draugr really know how to use their weapons. We need to be ready for several attacks at once.<br />
*34951*<br />
With two weapons they like to combo their attacks, but we can disrupt their flow by parrying their attacks.<br />
*34952*<br />
They can attack from long range, but we should be safe if we dodge or block.<br />
*34953*<br />
These speedy enemies can be hard to hit. Father should wait for them to rush him and parry their attacks.<br />
*34954*<br />
I see them stomp their feet right before they charge. Should help us spot their incoming attacks.<br />
*34955*<br />
We should avoid hitting them with melee attacks when they’re powered up, we’ll be knocked back by an explosion.<br />
*34956*<br />
Father should throw his axe at them when they’re powered up. They’ll explode and damage all nearby enemies.<br />
*34957*<br />
They power up their weapon and attack with a forward moving shockwave.<br />
*34958*<br />
They have a strong attack, but if we dodge to the side we should be okay.<br />
*34959*<br />
Revenant (Poison)<br />
*34960*<br />
Mother once told me that some witches trade little bits of their soul here and there to become more powerful in Seiðr magic. Eventually, they lose every part of their humanity and become Revenants. They can disappear in an instant, and these particular Revenants are able to spread poison through touch and breath.<br />
*34961*<br />
Revenant (Summoner)<br />
*34962*<br />
This kind of Revenant can actually summon Nightmares. Does she create them with her Seiðr magic, or are they all just squeezed together in her pack? I wonder how so many of them fit in that little pack.<br />

Tatzelwurm<br />
*34968*<br />
A Tatzelwurm is part lizard, part cat—a Lizard-Cat! Or a Cat-Lizard… or something. Either way, the combination is pretty weird. They like to burrow underground to close the distance between them and their prey. Their claws and teeth are extremely sharp, but it’s that poisonous barb on their tails that we really need to watch out for.<br />
*34969*<br />
Cursed Tatzelwurm<br />
*34970*<br />
This Tatzelwurm doesn’t have the poisonous barb, but it does have a sac in its throat that lets it barf poison at us. I know; it’s really gross. The poison is deadly to the touch, so even if we dodge the attack, we still need to be careful not to step in it.<br />
*34971*<br />
Brood<br />
*34973*<br />
Rabid Wolf<br />
*34974*<br />
Poison Wolf<br />
*34975*<br />
Hel-Brood<br />
*34976*<br />
Dark Elf<br />
*34977*<br />
Dark Elf Warrior<br />
*34978*<br />
Dark Elf Summoner<br />
*34979*<br />
Dark Elf Lord<br />
*34980*<br />
I’ve always admired wolves, but the ones we’ve encountered attack us on sight, which means they’re probably rabid. I guess to them, we are food. I know it’s kill or be killed, but still… they’re beautiful in their own way, and killing them makes me a little sad. Good thing Father probably won’t read this.<br />
*34981*<br />
We’ve seen a lot of aggressive wolves, but these are something else… some other kind of disease. They spit out some kind of poison that we should avoid walking in, and they’re even more aggressive than the rabid ones. I bet we would be doing them a favor by putting them out of their misery.<br />
*34982*<br />
These things are a complete mystery. They always show up in groups, but at least they go down fairly easily. They don’t have weapons, but they can grow their limbs into sharp points that are just as dangerous. They also tend to try and latch onto Father, and use their greater numbers to overwhelm us.<br />
*34983*<br />
These faceless creatures are very aggressive and don’t hesitate to run straight at us. They clearly have the same kind of ice powers we see from anything that comes from Hel. They fall very easily to Father’s Blades.<br />
*34984*<br />
Unlike the Light Elves of Alfheim, the Dark Elves prefer dark places. Maybe that’s why they want to cover up the Light? They can fly and seem pretty smart and well-coordinated; more so than most of the enemies we’ve fought so far. Their weapons are useful; effective up close and at a distance. Kind of like Father’s axe!<br />
*34985*<br />
This type seems stronger than the average Dark Elf. They swing their heavy weapons so hard it creates a shock wave, making their attacks really tough to dodge.<br />
*34986*<br />
This one is able to call in reinforcements, so we should take him down quickly. They should be easy to spot, thanks to the bright glow in their wings. I wonder how many Dark Elves there are in Alfheim?<br />
*34987*<br />
Bigger, faster, and stronger than any Dark Elf we’ve fought so far. Their attacks are so strong they can blind and deafen us for a bit. They fight a lot like regular Dark Elves, just WAY harder.<br />
*34988*<br />
A World Serpent Scale<br />
*34989*<br />
The Dwarves can take fragments of the World Serpent’s old scales and form a fresh scale.<br />
*34990*<br />
100 World Serpent Scale Fragments<br />
*34991*<br />
The Dwarves can break apart a scale of the World Serpent to form smaller fragments.<br />
*34992*<br />
Dauði Kaupmaðr<br />
*34993*<br />
I think the troll we just fought was Dauði Kaupmaðr. Mother used to always tell me stories about him to try and scare me if I wandered off too far. I think she’d be proud of me, but Father thinks because I got a little angry that I’m “not ready.” Whatever. I just helped him kill a troll; I know I’m ready!<br />
Mother told me a lot of stories about trolls. This one’s name translates to Death Merchant. With a name like that, I think it’s safe to assume he was pretty evil. I’m glad we killed him.<br />
*34994*<br />
Nightmare<br />
*34995*<br />
Mom used to tell me stories about Nightmares until, well… I started having nightmares. I was embarrassed, but she said they were just another part of life, and that sometimes there was “beauty in the horror.” She always saw the upside to everything, even these creepy little floating eye monsters. They’re named after an older creature, called a Mare, that sits on your chest while you sleep and feeds off your fear.<br />
*34996*<br />
Nightmare Parasite<br />
*34997*<br />
As if Nightmares weren’t annoying enough, it looks like this type can actually possess other creatures and make them stronger. Does the possessed creature have any control over their actions, or are they just trapped in some horrific waking nightmare? Not a very nice thought.<br />
*34998*<br />
Ogre<br />
*34999*<br />
Giant, powerful, angry, but thankfully not very smart. The Ogre is one of the ugliest enemies we’ve fought. Their huge arms give their attacks good range, and they can hit the ground so hard it creates powerful shock waves.<br />
*35000*<br />
Fierce Ogre<br />
*35001*<br />
These Ogres are similar in size to the regular ones, but they can cover long distances with a single jump. And… they smell REALLY bad. I wonder if that’s why they’re so angry all the time?<br />
*35002*<br />
Ice Nightmare<br />
*35003*<br />
These Nightmares can use the same power of frost that we’ve seen the Hel-Walkers use. These attacks will slow us down if they manage to hit.<br />
*35004*<br />
Hel-Revenant<br />
*35005*<br />
Like the other Hel-Walkers, the Hel-Revenant attacks with ice that can slow us down. Mother used to tell me bedtime stories about the Revenants, but she never mentioned this kind. Maybe she thought it was too scary for me.<br />

*35099*<br />
The water wheel that we freed earlier is blocking the way we came in. We’ll have to find a back door. I noticed a grate near the ship, I bet we can open it and get out that way.<br />

Stonebeard King<br />
*35109*<br />
Mother said Stonebeard King earned his title “King” simply because no one could take it from him. If you are arrogant enough to call yourself a king, you better be able to back it up, and Stonebeard could.  He never lost a fight… until now.<br />
*35110*<br />
Grendel of the Frost<br />
*35111*<br />
Grendel of the Frost was the stuff of legend. Even Mother thought he was just a myth. It was said that Grendel was the strongest and most feared among the Stone Troll Tribe. They hold the name “The Frost” in the highest regard, and only give it to someone who is to be honored and revered. And now he’s dead. Serves him right for trying to kill us!<br />
*35113*<br />
Death Eater<br />
*35115*<br />
Mother never mentioned this troll. Guess he never did anything special to earn an interesting bedtime story. And now he never will.<br />
*35116*<br />
Máttugr Helson<br />
*35117*<br />
Máttugr Helson, known as Helheim’s son and bridge keeper. Apparently, he was actually born and raised in Hel. Growing up in a troll tribe can’t be an easy life, but growing up in Hel must be even worse.<br />
*35118*<br />

Fire Nightmare<br />
*35222*<br />
These Nightmares shoot fireballs. As if we needed MORE reasons to hate Nightmares.<br />
*35223*<br />
Exploding Nightmare<br />
*35224*<br />
These Nightmares like to swarm in close and then explode. Why do they sacrifice themselves like this? Maybe they are all part of some kind of hive mind. Whatever the reason, it’s really annoying.<br />
*35225*<br />
Wolves typically hunt in packs and will try to surround their prey. Father should try to keep them in front of him and let me help draw their attention.<br />
*35226*<br />
When these wolves howl, we should be ready for a strong attack.<br />
*35227*<br />
We’ll have to be extra careful not to step in the stuff they vomit up. It’s poisonous. Smells real bad, too.<br />
*35228*<br />
The poison from these wolves makes attacking up close risky. My bow and Father’s axe throw is a safer way to take them down.<br />
*35229*<br />
Using the [HeavyAttackButton] axe throw will freeze them and bring them down to earth.<br />
*35230*<br />
My arrows can stun them which will allow Father to finish them off. If he grabs them when stunned, he can throw them at other enemies and they’ll explode!<br />
*35231*<br />
As soon as they start charging us, just one hit to their body will blow them up. The explosion hurts other enemies, too! Could be useful when fighting a big group.<br />
*35232*<br />
If they get too close to us, they’ll explode. We need to hit them at range.<br />
*35234*<br />
Brenna Dauði<br />
*35235*<br />
Dauði Munr<br />
*35236*<br />
Grendel of the Ashes<br />
*35237*<br />
Seiðr Reavers are able to heal, so if we start attacking one, we should try to finish the job quickly.<br />
*35238*<br />
When they die, they detonate in a poison cloud. If we’re too close, we should try to dodge away.<br />
*35241*<br />
They only attack after they’ve conjured an explosive Seiðr magic spell. We should rush them down before they can throw it, or try and dodge.<br />
*35242*<br />
If they do create their bomb, Father can disrupt them by throwing his axe before they have time to throw it.<br />
*35243*<br />
We should kill these guys quickly, they’re able to heal from most wounds.<br />
*35244*<br />
We should watch out when they power up their weapon with Seiðr magic. They can do a powerful triple slam attack.<br />
*35245*<br />
He is slow but very sturdy. We should dodge his horizontal swings backwards and his vertical swings sideways and attack him in the time it takes to recover.<br />
*35246*<br />
The Traveler has a magical rune. If we see him lift it in his hand, Father should throw his axe at it.<br />
*35247*<br />
These Travelers must be a paranoid bunch, because they keep a huge shield on their back that will deflect any attempt to back stab him.<br />
*35248*<br />
We’ll have to watch for him to turn and attack before striking him from the front.<br />
*35249*<br />
These Nightmares come after me and try to take me out of the fight, but Father can stop them. Hopefully he will…<br />
*35250*<br />
We can either dodge their shots, or interrupt them with an arrow or axe throw. The stronger ones can shoot faster.<br />
*35251*<br />
These Nightmares try their hardest to possess other enemies, making those enemies a lot stronger.<br />
*35252*<br />
If we stun or kill a possessed enemy, it will force the possessing Nightmare out of their body.<br />
*35253*<br />
They can poison us, and we need to be extra careful of their leaping attack.<br />
*35254*<br />
The Brood explode when they die. We can use this to damage and knock away any nearby enemies.<br />
*35255*<br />
Her pestilence powder leaves poison hazards in the environment. If Father steps in them, he’ll be damaged and poisoned.<br />
*35256*<br />
Her fissure attack can move around obstacles to hit us. Father has a better chance of dodging if he waits until it’s closer.<br />
*35257*<br />
She tries to summon Nightmares often, so we need to make sure we interrupt her to avoid being overrun by them.<br />
*35258*<br />
Her powder smokescreen clouds can blind us, and they provide cover for her follow-up attacks. We should avoid them as much as we possibly can.<br />
*35259*<br />
When Father throws his axe at a Tatzelwurm as it burrows towards him, it’ll pop them out of the ground.<br />
*35260*<br />
Launching and attacking Tatzelwurms as they dig into the ground will stop them from burrowing for a short time.<br />
*35261*<br />
Their spit is highly poisonous, even on the ground. Throwing the axe with [HeavyAttackButton] will freeze them and keep them from burrowing underground.<br />
*35262*<br />
Attacks that slam the ground can pop nearby Tatzelwurms out of their burrows.<br />
*35263*<br />
This Ogre has a very quick tell before he attacks. Father can use that to get out of the way.<br />
*35264*<br />
Father is strong enough to block one of his attacks, but it takes some time for him to recover. Smarter to avoid it altogether.<br />
*35265*<br />
If Father can goad an Ogre into using their jump smash, it’ll take them a couple of moments to recover if they miss. I just hope they miss.<br />
*35266*<br />
Getting behind an Ogre is a good opportunity for Father to do some damage. But if they turn and see him, they’ll definitely attack.<br />
*35267*<br />
A Wulver’s howl is a sign they are going into a frenzy, where they can attack with incredible speed.<br />
*35268*<br />
If Father finds himself caught in the Wulver’s frenzy attack, I may be able to draw the Wulver’s attention with a well placed arrow.<br />
*35269*<br />
When a Wulver crouches on all fours, they become very difficult to hit. We need to be on our guard and not leave ourselves open to counter attack.<br />
*35270*<br />
The other Wulver gets a lot faster after it starts howling. This one seems to get a lot stronger. We should be really, really careful after this one starts howling.<br />
*35273*<br />
These enemies become enraged and super aggressive when you’re frosted. Father should do his best to avoid their frost blast attack.<br />
*35274*<br />
If these things do manage to freeze us, we should stay on the defensive until it passes.<br />
*35275*<br />
Hel-Walkers with shields can block just about anything. Father can use his Block Break skill to break their guard.<br />
*35276*<br />
Father should throw his axe at their feet to get around their shields and trip them up.<br />
*35277*<br />
These enemies will deflect Father’s frost axe attacks. He’ll have to use his fists instead to stun them.<br />
*35278*<br />
Hel-Walkers seem to draw their power from the frost, which makes Father’s axe pretty weak against them. Good thing he’s strong with his fists, too. I wish we had a fire weapon.<br />
*35279*<br />
Their projectiles are quick but don’t stun us. If we rush them, we can take them out of the equation early.<br />
*35280*<br />
I should be able to help Father with these enemies. Just like their projectiles disrupt his movements, my bow can disrupt theirs.<br />
*35281*<br />
They can cast an ice wall as cover. Father can throw the axe when they pop up behind cover, or throw it past them and recall it to hit them from behind.<br />
*35282*<br />
Their ice walls do more than just provide cover: if we get too close, they can detonate it. We should try to deal with them from range.<br />
*35283*<br />
Father can dodge his mace depending on the type of swing. Looks like it’s best to dodge horizontal swings backwards, and the vertical swings sideways.<br />
*35284*<br />
If he misses his overhead attack, his mace gets stuck in the ground and he’s open for an attack.<br />
*35285*<br />
The Undead Travelers are more aggressive than the regular ones. Ranged attacks are tricky, because he sprints right at us.<br />
*35286*<br />
We can whittle down his armor if we stay close and dodge his strikes. But when he charges up his sword for an overhead strike, it’s time to move!<br />
*35287*<br />
They’ll look straight up before firing their ice projectile, so we should either get out of the way or hit them with Father’s axe (or my arrows).<br />
*35288*<br />
When Father throws his axe at Nightmares, it knocks them closer to the ground. Then he can use melee attacks to finish them off.<br />
*35289*<br />
Their air slam attacks can leave us slowed. If they’re up in the air, steer clear.<br />
*35290*<br />
The Brood are extremely weak to Father’s Runic Attacks.<br />
*35291*<br />
Her icy fissure attacks damage and freeze Father. We’ll have to avoid them if we want to be able to take her down.<br />
*35292*<br />
We can either interrupt, outrun, or dodge her ice-breath attack – it can freeze Father and leave him idle and vulnerable to attacks.<br />
*35296*<br />
Dark Elves like to attack as a group. When Father lands a heavy hit or parries, it tends to break the swarm.<br />
*35297*<br />
If we can freeze or weaken the Dark Elves, it will prevent them from using air recoveries when launched.<br />
*35298*<br />
We should watch out for their charge attacks. They can cause temporary blindness. It’s hard to fight when you can’t see anything!<br />
*35299*<br />
They are much easier to kill when grounded. Tripping them up seems to work pretty well.<br />
*35300*<br />
When he spins his weapon, it means he’s about to call in more Dark Elves. We should stop him before he slams it into the ground.<br />
*35301*<br />
He can block axe throws, but if we catch him off guard, Father’s heavy axe throw will freeze him and negate his speed.<br />
*35302*<br />
It’s so strong and has thick armor, but leaves itself open after certain attacks.<br />
*35303*<br />
If we can freeze or weaken it, it won’t be able to recover in the air when launched or knocked out of aerial attacks.<br />
*35304*<br />
Father can hit them twice on the same axe throw; once on the throw and again on the recall.<br />
*35305*<br />
These would make good target practice for me and my bow. A couple of arrows would probably bring them down.<br />

Reaver<br />
*36833*<br />
These were just normal human Reavers once, but they look like they’ve been corrupted by Seiðr magic. When did this start happening?<br />
*36834*<br />
Shadow<br />
*36835*<br />
These were human Reavers, but now that they’ve embraced the ways of the Seiðr, they can throw magic spells at a distance.<br />
*36836*<br />
Viken<br />
*36837*<br />
These Seiðr Reavers like to use big maces when they fight. Mom always referred to them as “Vikens,” for some reason.<br />
*36838*<br />
Traveler<br />
*36839*<br />
They wear really strong armor, have huge swords, and are one of the toughest enemies we’ve faced. Who are they, and what do they want with us? Mom never mentioned the Travelers. I hope we don’t have to fight too many of them.<br />
*36954*<br />
Traveler Champion<br />
*36955*<br />
This Traveler has a huge shield on his back, which makes breaking through his extremely tough armor even tougher.<br />
*36956*<br />
Wulver<br />
*36957*<br />
They look like wolves, but they stand upright like humans and are a lot smarter. And stronger. And faster. Their fur is so dense, it makes them tough to put down. They remind me a little of those Berserkers that Father put down last summer… but wolves instead of bears.<br />
*36958*<br />
Fierce Wulver<br />
*36959*<br />
This looks like an even tougher breed of Wulver. They’re smarter, too. Really, really dangerous creatures. Glad my bowstring has some magic in it, otherwise I’m not sure how we’d bring these stronger ones down.<br />
*36960*<br />
?????????<br />
*36961*<br />
What is this thing? It looked like a Reaver, but its voice sounds so strange… Even Father doesn’t know.<br />
*36962*<br />
Hel-Reaver Guard<br />
*36963*<br />
It’s a Hel-Reaver, but it carries a shield and it knows how to use it. Guess they aren’t completely mindless.<br />
*36964*<br />
Hel-Reaver Lord<br />
*36965*<br />
These must’ve been strong Reavers back when they were alive. Now that they’re dead they are even stronger Hel-Reavers.<br />
*36966*<br />
Hel-Shadow Archer<br />
*36967*<br />
It’s like one of the Shadows, but it uses ice magic like a thrown spear. Must be one of the Hel-Walkers.<br />
*36968*<br />
Hel-Shadow Scout<br />
*36969*<br />
It acts like a Shadow, but uses ice magic instead of Seiðr magic. Definitely a Hel-Walker.<br />
*36970*<br />
Hel-Viken<br />
*36971*<br />
It’s a Viken, but a dead one. So, a Hel-Viken? This Hel-Walker is just as strong as its Seiðr counterpart. Maybe even stronger.<br />
*36972*<br />
Hel-Traveler<br />
*36973*<br />
I didn’t think the Travelers could get much worse, but it looks like death wasn’t enough to keep this one down. In fact, it’s even MORE aggressive than the other Travelers we’ve seen. I guess even Travelers can become Hel-Walkers.<br />

We’re going back to the Lake of Nine to talk to the World Serpent again, since Mimir speaks his language. I wonder if I could learn it too?<br />

We met this Dwarf on our way to the Mountain, and he’s a blacksmith. A famous blacksmith, apparently. He made the Leviathan Axe! He upgraded it for Father, too. He was a little rude and grouchy, but I kind of like him anyway. I hope we see him again!<br />
*37129*<br />
Sindri<br />
*37130*<br />
Sindri’s also a famous blacksmith, but he and his brother are really different. Sindri REALLY doesn’t like dirt and grime. Weird trait for a blacksmith Dwarf, but he’s just as talented as his brother. I wonder why they don’t get along?<br />
*37131*<br />
Blightguard<br />
*37132*<br />
Andvari<br />
*37133*<br />
Low Perk activation chance to strike with an explosive curse that inflicts WEAKNESS to enemies on any successful hit.<br />
*37134*<br />
Andvari wasn’t very helpful at first, but something about seeing that dead Soul Eater in the Landsuther Mines made him realize he was being kind of a jerk. I think he feels guilty because he and some other Dwarves were experimenting with Ancients there, and they accidentally created Soul Eaters. Glad we didn’t have to fight any more.<br />
Anyway, his soul is still trapped in a ring. Brok wanted to melt him down (he can be so mean sometimes!), but I convinced Father to keep him, and now he’s part of our group. Father even uses Andvari’s soul as an Enchantment sometimes. Must be hard being trapped in a piece of jewelry, but Andvari doesn’t complain TOO much. I’ve gotten pretty good at ignoring him.<br />
*37135*<br />
Motsògnir<br />
*37136*<br />
Grips of the Valkyrie<br />
*37137*<br />
The Dwarf King. One of the Sons of Ivaldi. He ruled over humans both in Veithurgard and Konùnsgard. He was a good king at first, but then he started having dreams about his people dying. For some reason, he thought forcing them to hunt deadly beasts was the way to save them. He captured three dragons to harvest their ‘Fury’, killed innocent people to harvest their ‘Screams’, and was then killed by those very same people when they returned as Hel-Walkers. That created ‘Ultimate Sacrifice.’ We can use these three ingredients to create some kind of legendary armor.<br />
*37138*<br />
Baldur<br />
*37139*<br />
Baldur… He’s one of the Aesir. Odin’s son, Thor’s brother. He came to our house and fought Father and Father killed him. Or… so we thought. Supposedly he can’t feel pain. And now he’s hunting us with his nephews, but we don’t know why.<br />
*37140*<br />
Low Perk activation chance on any successful Blades hit to grant Power of the Valkyrie, increasing [Icons:STRENGTH] STRENGTH and [Icons:RUNIC] RUNIC. (Stacks up to 3 times max.)<br />
*37141*<br />
Witch of the Woods<br />
*37142*<br />
We met a Witch in the Woods who knows the old magic! Turns out the magic boar is her friend. She was mad that I shot him at first, but we were able to save his life. She lives under a giant turtle creature (who’s also her friend) and she seems really nice.<br />
*37143*<br />
Magni<br />
*37144*<br />
Evasive Defense<br />
*37145*<br />
The older son of Thor. He had a huge sword, could use the power of lightning, and was really mean. Father killed him.<br />
*37146*<br />
Modi<br />
*37147*<br />
Evasive Runic<br />
*37148*<br />
The younger son of Thor, and a relentless creep. He also can shoot lightning, and uses a mace and shield. He ran off after Father killed his brother, Magni, but I bet we haven’t seen the last of him. I’ll kill him next time I see him.<br />
*37149*<br />

Mom once told me a story about Otr; he was a Dwarf who could turn into an otter (which is how he got his name, I guess). Is this the same Otr? How did he become a dragon? I’d ask Father, but I know he doesn’t care. It’s when I have so many questions like this… that’s when I miss Mother the most.<br />
*37159*<br />
Reginn<br />
*37160*<br />
Reginn was captured by the Dwarf King and forced to act as Sentry of Konùnsgard. He’s not very good at it; there are monsters everywhere. I guess that’s what happens when you force a dragon to stand guard against his will. The Dwarf King must’ve wanted to capture these dragons for a different purpose…<br />
*37161*<br />
Fáfnir<br />
*37162*<br />
Fáfnir was a Dwarf. One of the Sons of Ivaldi, according to Mimir. But he was very greedy, and his greed turned him into a dragon. It sounds ridiculous, but I saw him with my own eyes… he was a dragon! I wonder if it was painful to turn from Dwarf to dragon? How long did it take? I had a bunch of questions for him, but he flew off before I could ask any.<br />
*37163*<br />
Gullveig<br />
*37164*<br />
A spirit convinced me that Gullveig, a powerful witch that was killed a long time ago, could “reunite” us with Mother. Father didn’t believe him. I shouldn’t have either… but for a chance to see Mom again, it seemed like we should give it a try, right?<br />
Once we collected all her bones, Gullveig was resurrected, and said she’d reunite us, “In death!” And then attacked us. We killed her, obviously. I was really upset with myself. How could I fall for such an obvious lie? But Father said to “take it as a lesson,” so that’s what I’m gonna do. No more trusting spirits.<br />
*37165*<br />
Dragons<br />
*37166*<br />
Valkyries<br />
*37167*<br />
Gunnr<br />
*37168*<br />
Mimir said of Gunnr: “Mistress of War. After any conflict, big or small, she would be first on the scene, sussing out the worthy spirits for a free trip to Valhalla. A gruesome task, but she took great pride in it. Her judgement of the fallen was unparalleled, and an invaluable resource to Odin. She was one of his favorites.”<br />
*37169*<br />
Geirdriful<br />
*37170*<br />
Mimir said of Geirdriful: “Master of Arms in Valhalla. Responsible for arming and training Odin’s einherjar. His army, come Ragnarök. The einherjar wait in the great hall, endlessly feasting, drinking and fu— ahem uh… fornicating themselves silly. Once Ragnarök begins, Odin calls them into service to fight on his behalf. Geirdriful had her hands full, training that lot.”<br />
*37171*<br />
Eir<br />
*37172*<br />
Mimir said of Eir: “The Healer. Strange, for a Valkyrie. Very quiet. Very calm. Where her sisters were violent rapids, Eir was a gentle stream. She healed the wounds of both mortals and gods… and even a certain all-knowing sage who once drank too much and fell off a mountain.”<br />
*37173*<br />
Prayer to Odin<br />
*37174*<br />
Beware of Seiðr<br />
*37175*<br />
“Find here our sacrifice, mighty Allfather, and deliver Midgard from Hel’s wild hunt. Odin, wisest of all, whose breath gave life to Ask and Embla, first among our people, we beg your protection. Send forth your noble Valkyries and cull the deathless. Send forth your noble sons, Thor and Baldur, to shield us. Send forth dragons to consume the frigid horde. Save our souls that we may serve you evermore.”\n\nI don’t think Odin got the message. Or he didn’t care…<br />
*37176*<br />
“Beware of Seiðr and those who practice it! Their sorcery is insidious and ever-changing, and so are the souls who master it. The more power they summon, the less they are themselves.”\n\nIs that how they turn into Revenants?<br />
*37177*<br />
The Light of Alfheim<br />
*37178*<br />
“From the light we are born, and to light we return. The light is the river of souls, transforming us, consuming us, transcending life and death. The light is the truth. The light is all.”\n\nOKAY! The light sounds great but maybe it also makes you crazy?<br />
*37179*<br />
The Great Mountain<br />
*37180*<br />
“When the mountain was cold, it was Meløða and Ǫnþreis who gave it life. Wandering souls from distant lands, who had tasted of the Mead of Poetry and in search of inspiration found each other—and in each other, found great love. To the summit of Midgard’s great mountain, a secret bridge was built. Here they would make their hearth and fortress—to live free of prophecy, and know only themselves and each other. The mountain became a shelter for the outcast and the artist, for Jötnar and new friends made. And to this beacon many more souls made pilgrimage. Even now, as we shelter from the storm, let none forget the beckoning spirit of the mountain that was.”\n\nSounds like the mountain used to be pretty amazing… Mom always did love artists.<br />
*37181*<br />
Rites of Fjörgyn<br />
*37182*<br />
“Here we bear witness to the funeral rites of Fjörgyn of the Jötnar, goddess of the earth and trees. For her beauty she was seduced, for her love she was betrayed, and for her gift of life, her life was claimed. To the summit and across the bridge she shall be borne, where nevermore the Thunder may find her.”\n\nDid Thor kill his own mother?! Was that the first Giant he killed? What does it mean??<br />
*37183*<br />
The Long, Cruel War<br />
*37184*<br />
“Here fell Nerthus of the Vanir, slain by Magni and Modi, sons of Thor. The Jötnar bear witness to the cruelty of this Long War. Neither Aesir nor Vanir may triumph, it is foreseen -- but what may be left of Midgard before they lay down arms?”\n\nThe Giants wanted peace… no wonder they liked Týr so much…<br />
*37185*<br />
Prayer to Frigg<br />
*37186*<br />
“Hail Frigg! Generous Frigg, who gave the world her brightest light — young Baldur, gleaming god, pride of the Aesir, Odin-Son and heir to Asgard. Long may she protect him. Long may he protect us. Hail Baldur the Golden. Hail Frigg, beloved of all! Hail Odin Allfather!”\n\nSeems like nobody who counted on the Aesir is still around…<br />
*37187*<br />
Motsògnir’s Throne<br />
*37188*<br />
“After many winters, the Stronghold of Konùnsgard is complete! Mótsognir has invited all citizens to attend the grand ceremony in the throne room. There we await the calming words of our King, who promises everlasting safety and prosperity.<br />
This new land is even more fertile than Veithurgard. And with Reginn as our stalwart sentry, we fear naught from the Reavers, Dark Elves, nor any malevolent force! The reign of King Mótsognir is truly blessed by Týr himself! All Hail the Dwarf King, Protector of Man!”<br />
Huh, sounds like they actually liked this Dwarf King. The people in Veithurgard sure didn’t… I wonder what changed?<br />
*37189*<br />
Reginn of Konùnsgard<br />
*37190*<br />
“Much like Otr of Veithurgard, Reginn has been conscripted as Head Sentry of Konùnsgard. Though he may occasionally struggle against his bindings, he takes great pride in his task. His thunderous breath, while extraordinarily dangerous, is merely his way of expressing pride. However, do take caution during weekly maintenance of the Dragon Shrines; Reginn will attempt to use his breath on you. This is not meant as an attack; it is merely his own cheeky way of passing the time. But make sure you vacate the area immediately, because it will kill you.<br />
All rumors that Reginn’s presence attracts the Dark Elves of Alfheim is pure fiction. King Mótsognir will protect us from all beasts, as he has done time and time again.”<br />
Yeah… I don’t believe any of this.<br />
*37191*<br />
Ruins of Veithurgard<br />
*37192*<br />
“Nothing remains of Veithurgard except the ruins of Mótsognir’s cruelty. The once fertile soil is barren, soaked with the blood of both hunters and the hunted. It was The ‘Noble’ Dwarf King himself who demanded the bloodshed. He who conscripted the gentle farmers of these lands into an army of ill-equipped hunters; he whose thirst for savage beasts produced a legion of widows.<br />
The castle still stands for those foolish enough to scavenge, wherein dwells the deadliest of his quarry. Let caution guide you.”<br />
Yikes… Doesn’t sound like a very nice place. Father will probably want to visit anyways to look for useful resources. He’s gotten a little predictable, but I’m still having fun seeing new places with him.<br />
*37193*<br />
An Unbreakable Chain<br />
*37194*<br />
“Otr has escaped his binds yet again. Instead of flying off this time, he seeks revenge on his captors, and is determined to turn Veithurgard to ash. We seek shelter in the outlying caves where we’ve found sanctuary in the past.<br />
Our King assures us his next chain will be unbreakable. If anyone can build an unbreakable chain, it’s Mótsognir. Architect of the great Stronghold of Konùnsgard! Leader of a glorious new age in Veithurgard! All Hail the Dwarf King, Protector of Man!”<br />
These people seem a little friendlier… for all the good it did them.<br />
*37195*<br />
Cost of the Hunt<br />
*37196*<br />
“Six Wolves – Two men. Lo do they call to me.<br />
Thirteen Draugr – Nine men. Lo do they call to me.<br />
Three Tatzelwurms – Six men. Lo do they call to me.<br />
One Troll – One and forty men. Lo do they call to me.<br />
One Dragon – Nine and ninety men. Lo do they call to me.”<br />
Sounds like these people weren’t very good at hunting. Maybe they should’ve just stuck with deer and boar.<br />
*37197*<br />
The Gravedigger<br />
*37198*<br />
“While I throw dirt on the mangled citizens of Veithurgard, Mótsognir looks upon his newly caged beast with a gleeful fervor. I curse his name. The Dwarf King set the capture of trolls and dragons above the safety of his own followers. The same followers who served and revered him, hunted these monsters, and died, forgotten.<br />
My attempt to free the beast failed, and Mótsognir’s punishment was swift: I am banned from Konùnsgard. Demoted to town gravedigger. A fitting end for a once proud hunter, whose prey hastened the fall of Veithurgard.”<br />
—Berhtolt<br />
*37199*<br />
The Hunt for Death<br />
*37200*<br />
“We baited the beast with a stuck fawn. Her cries echoed on the morning breeze. It did not take long for Death’s Hammer to approach. The smell of burnt grass, the bleating of the dying fawn, the fear of imminent death… many could not hold their breakfast. When it stepped into the clearing, our attack was swift.<br />
The vanguard died instantly, burned to ash. No time to react, the hunt continued as we led the enraged troll to the Lake of Nine. There we subdued it, but not before losing thirty more men.<br />
Upon our return, King Mótsognir proclaimed a week of celebration. The festivities were sparsely attended, though not for lack of pride in the victory. The population of Veithurgard had just been reduced by a quarter. I fear this sad irony was lost on the Dwarf.”<br />
—Berhtolt<br />
*37201*<br />
The Curse of Ivaldi<br />
*37202*<br />
“Turn back! Upon this place sits the curse of Ivaldi, whose talents threatened the gods of Asgard. The mists of Niflheim were made a weapon by my father’s alchemy, and turned upon their creator. His skill as an inventor and craftsman were unrivaled… but it was his talent and genius which drew the ire of the Aesir in the first place. Therefore I, Mótsognir, renounce this place. I renounce dwarvenkind. I am off to seek refuge and self-imposed exile in Midgard. Those who do not flee this realm will join my father in the grave.”<br />
—Mótsognir, Son of Ivaldi<br />
*37212*<br />
Completed<br />
*37213*<br />
Ivaldi’s armor was the peak of Niflheim craftsmanship, but this set is small and has grown decrepit. Sindri may be able to make use of it.<br />
*37214*<br />
Anchor of Fog<br />
*37215*<br />
To hide his machinations from Odin, Ivaldi crafted devices that could pull anything from Niflheim back to its home. Use (with caution) to open Realm Tears in Niflheim.<br />

Göndul<br />
*37352*<br />
Mimir said of Göndul: “The sight of Göndul always took my breath away. Göndul had a silver tongue, a sharp wit, and struck a figure so stunning, it literally drove men insane. Odin forbid her from setting foot in Midgard after a time, as insanity is not a welcome trait in Valhalla.”<br />
*37353*<br />
Hildr<br />
*37354*<br />
Mimir said of Hildr: “Mistress of Battle. She and Odin got on quite well, actually. Her and the other Valkyries… not so much. She would spend most of her time here in Midgard, observing discord between the living, and stirring some up herself from time to time. She lived for conflict. Some say she WAS conflict, personified. I wonder what will become of her, now that she’s free.”<br />
*37355*<br />
Olrun<br />
*37356*<br />
Mimir said of Olrun: “Once the daughter of a powerful chieftain, she fell defending him during a Reaver attack. Olrun was escorted to Valhalla, where she chose to devote her after-life to the pursuit of knowledge above all else. Quite unusual behavior amongst the constant drinking and feasting of her fellow Valhallian-denizens. Odin saw a kindred spirit in Olrun’s single-minded pursuit of knowledge and appointed her as the Valkyrie’s resident historian.”<br />
*37357*<br />
Kara<br />
*37358*<br />
Mimir said of Kara: “Wild Storm personified. Calm and collected… Then the air would shift, and the fury of her storm would unleash. ’Twas beautiful, in a way, assuming you could find proper shelter. Her tears would cleanse the blood-soaked battlefields.”<br />

Mimir said of Ròta: “One of the Choosers of the Slain. Ròta was the first to go mad after being imprisoned in a physical form. Sigrun stashed her in Helheim to keep her away from harming herself or others. Mostly others.”<br />
*37361*<br />
Sigrun<br />
*37362*<br />
Mimir said of Sigrun: “Queen of the Valkyries, although she does not appear to refer to herself as such. When Freya, the original Queen Valkyrie, lost her wings to Odin, Sigrun grudgingly took the position in her stead. Now she is free to reunite the Valkyries and attempt to stem the tide of the dead flowing into Midgard.”<br />
*37363*<br />
The Soul Eaters<br />
*37364*<br />
“Removing an Ancient’s soul and domesticating it as a beast of burden was surprisingly easy. They followed my every command, and appeared to possess no free will, sense of self-preservation, or even hunger. Well… not until it turned poor Lit into ashes. Not even his soul remained.<br />
A lack of their own must be what drives them to immolate the souls of others. My ‘Soul Eaters’ are an abomination. Several were sent to Muspelheim at the request of Surtr; what he will use them for, I shudder to consider. Another to Mótsognir at Konùnsgard; that fool can burn for all I care.  My immediate concern is the Dwarves of the Völunder Mines.  I pray I’m not too late to undo my mistake.”<br />
—Andvari<br />
*37365*<br />
This is the second troll we’ve seen so far. I had no idea they were so close to our house! They’ve never bothered us before… but I guess we never bothered them either. Mother said if I ever saw a troll, I should run the other way. Guess she never said that to Father.<br />
*37366*<br />
We killed this one while trying to restore the Jötunheim Tower to the Lake of Nine in all the realms. When the doors opened to Muspelheim, I guess he wanted to see what was happening.  Why is every troll’s first and only instinct to attack?<br />
*37367*<br />
This must have been the other Grendel’s brother? Or maybe “The Ashes” is a different kind of title that the Fire Trolls use to honor their kind. There’s so much we don’t know about trolls… but I guess the most important thing to know is that they are all trying to kill us, so we have to kill them first. That’s what Father would say, anyways.<br />

A Son’s Regret<br />
*37459*<br />
“Dad,<br />
While you were off hunting and pillaging, Granddad raised me. Taught and cared for me. I loved him—and you stabbed him in the back. I hated you. But time has a way of changing things.<br />
The clan celebrated. They spat on his kind spirit; saw it as proof of weak leadership. And as much as I hate to admit it, the Hræzla Farmaðr thrived with you at the helm.<br />
As a boy, I made an oath to the Nornir that I would avenge him. My skill with a blade grew, and you finally began to notice me. We grew closer. But the Nornir do not suffer broken oaths. Not even those made by a grieving child.<br />
Their chest outside Fáfnir’s Storeroom… it reminded me of that oath. So the cycle of betrayal continues. You killed the only father I ever knew, but even now… I regret my actions, and am filled with remorse. Forgive me.”<br />

Draugr fight with dangerous weapons, but they aren’t very skilled with them. Not like Father and his axe.  If we watch their movements, it should be easy to dodge or block their attacks.<br />
*37535*<br />
These basic Draugr aren’t very fast or strong. We can dodge or block them, and take them down pretty easily.<br />
*37750*<br />
The Hræzla Farmaðr<br />
*37751*<br />
“To know the Hræzla Farmaðr is to know the brutal history of these lands. Before the Great Flood, before the Desolation, men lived peacefully in Midgard. The dead stayed dead, Draugr were a rarity, and the use of Seiðr magic was considered deeply shameful. The Hræzla Farmaðr is of the Old Ways; when a man’s worth is measured by how well he swings a blade. Strength—our highest virtue. These are harsh lands, and they are no place for the weak. The strong will prosper in life, and in death, join the ranks of the einherjar in Valhalla. The weak will scrape and suffer a meager existence, joining the ranks of unworthy in the depths of Helheim. Such is the cycle of life, ’til Ragnarök comes.”<br />
Harsh. They sound about as friendly as a pack of Wulvers.<br />

Hel-Reaver<br />
*37808*<br />
First, it was a human Reaver. Then we killed it. It died in battle, so shouldn’t the Valkyries have taken it to Valhalla? But they didn’t… it just came back as something else.<br />
Before she died, I overheard Mother telling Father that, “The Hel-Walkers were returning.” Is this what she was talking about? People rising from the dead? Father doesn’t seem to know (or care) much about it. Since this thing used to be a Reaver, I’ll call them, “Hel-Reavers.”<br />

“I hear many rumors during my travels. And while rumors have no place along the Path, their consistency gives them credence. I hear of three dragons, imprisoned in Midgard. One in Veithurgard, one in Konùnsgard, and one in a hidden ravine alongside the Lake of Nine. Should the rumors be true, these dragons are surely worth investigating.”<br />

Soul Eater<br />
*37867*<br />
They look almost exactly like Ancients, but there’s something… off about them. Mom always called the Soul Eaters, “Dangerous abominations.” She never said a bad word about ANY living creature (even poisonous bugs!), so her saying that always stuck with me. I wish I could tell her Father and I killed one.<br />
*37868*<br />
Dark Soul Eater<br />
*37869*<br />
An Ancient whose soul has been removed by dark Dwarven magic. It’s stronger than a regular Soul Eater, and even THOSE still terrify me.<br />
*37870*<br />
Frost Ancient<br />
*37871*<br />
We ran into a Frost Ancient on our way up the Mountain. Before this journey, I thought all the Ancients were made of fire and rock, but I guess it’s just the rock part they all share. This one must have originally been part of the Mountain itself. I bet it got tired of being a mountain, and one day just got up and walked away.<br />
*37872*<br />
Ice Ancient<br />
*37873*<br />
An Ancient in the ice and snow… I wonder if they have thoughts like we do? I can’t hear any. They don’t have mouths or ears… none that I can see, anyways. They’re mostly pretty peaceful, unless we attack first. I’d never say this to Father, but I wish we could just leave them alone.<br />
*37874*<br />
Stone Ancient<br />
*37875*<br />
One of the Ancients… I can’t believe it! Did Mom know they were still alive? They’re, well… ancient! Supposedly they’re a part of Ymir himself, and they’ve been around since the beginning of time. I thought they were all in Midgard… I wonder why this one is in Alfheim?<br />
*37876*<br />
Forest Ancient<br />
*37877*<br />
We ran into an Ancient of the Forest on our way out of Fáfnir’s Storeroom. This one was walking around, instead of just hibernating like most of them do. Or maybe we woke it up while we were trying to get inside? These Ancients are kind of beautiful… I wish their hearts weren’t so valuable.<br />
*37878*<br />
Fire Ancient<br />
*37879*<br />
I could feel the heat off this one from the boat. I guess now we know what happened to all these broken ships…<br />
*37880*<br />
Lava Ancient<br />
*37881*<br />
This Ancient has been underwater for a long time… How does it keep its fire? And why didn’t it seek higher ground?  Maybe it goes into a kind of hibernation when it’s underwater?<br />

A King’s Last Words<br />
*37973*<br />
“Tragic that my failure becomes apparent as the life flows out of me. The gods came to me as I slept, and demanded retribution for my father’s actions in Niflheim. My people… they who entrusted me to keep them safe… every damned night, visions of them mangled by all manner of beast. Only I could protect them—and only through building the Dvegræðikr.  I captured every deadly beast I could find, and set to building myth.<br />
The dreams were very clear about the first two ingredients: Dragons’ Fury and Screams of the Innocent. Though many were sacrificed capturing the dragons, and the innocents’ screams were far worse than I ever imagined, all of it was for the greater good.<br />
Of the third ingredient, my dreams were vague. Ultimate Sacrifice is all they would say. I hoped that forfeiting my morality during this damned search would be enough. Now I see it was my own sacrifice that was required.<br />
Like my father before me, I’ve been such a fool.”<br />

“I used to live for the hunt. The excitement of stalking prey gave me a new purpose in life, one far more rewarding than the simple joy of watching crops grow. Each hunt gave me newfound confidence, and as my skill grew, so too did my arrogance.<br />
I downed a particularly savage Tatzelwurm on this last hunt. The beast nearly gored me several times, and my blood was hot after so many close calls. I stood over its lifeless body, too occupied with my triumph to notice its mate behind me—a mistake that cost me dearly.<br />
As the poison works its way to my heart, I reflect on the path my life took after the Dwarf King landed in Veithurgard, and formed his army of hunters. He gave me new purpose in life, true… but I would trade it all to spend one more day with my family as a simple farmer.”<br />
*38163*<br />
Land of Kings<br />
*38164*<br />
“Despite Otr’s presence, monsters continue to flood into Veithurgard. They poison our crops, maim our farmers, and make an already miserable existence all the more unbearable. But just as our situation reaches a breaking point, Mótsognir brings word of a safe haven; a new land he has dubbed Konùnsgard. ‘A land of riches, free from strife and danger.’ There he has promised to build us a great stronghold to shelter and protect us—though I cannot bring myself to fully trust his words. It was his irrational thirst for such monsters that brought them here to begin with! Nevertheless, it has been so long since we’ve known safety. Veithurgard was once a beautiful land. I pray to Sif that this new land of Konùnsgard is able to weather The Dwarf King’s greed.”<br />

“To my dearest Thorrin,<br />
When I was your age, I used to dream of being a god, just like our beloved Thor. It’s the reason we’re a family of stone masons; your mother and I wanted to spend our days swinging a hammer! You’ll learn, however, that dreams fade as you grow older. We’ll never join the Aesir in the halls of Asgard, but we can still use our skill to honor them.<br />
Your mother and I have grand plans here in Veithurgard to build a statue of Odin’s favorite son. It will be our life’s greatest work, second only to bringing you into this world.<br />
I’ve just completed a powerful pommel for my hammer and named it after one of Thor’s legendary goats, as it calls on the power of thunder itself. One day, when I am gone, it will keep you safe. When you hold it in your hands, let it be a reminder of all the joy that Thor has brought to our family.”<br />

The Dream of Midgard<br />
*38188*<br />
“Midgard was a dream of what could be if we shared, and collaborated. Jötnar, Aesir, Vanir, Elf, Dwarf, and mortals most of all. It was beautiful. But not everyone is capable of sharing. Some believe anything uncontrolled is savage, and threatening. And so we were mocked, and tricked, and used, and then slaughtered.\n\nOdin and his tribe were barred from our realm, but it was not enough. The wrath of Thor and his terrible hammer have thinned our number in Midgard to the brink of ruin. There is no option but to withdraw, while yet any live to do so.”\n\nOdin and Thor would have killed ALL the Giants if they could… and they got away with everything!<br />
*38189*<br />
The Guardian Returns<br />
*38190*<br />
“We foresee Midgard’s fate - overrun, a second Hel. Neither Odin nor his dead may reach Jötunheim. The ways must be shut. The serpent and the guardian remained. They alone shall keep our hope. When doom befalls the indestructible, only then shall the guardian return.\n\nUntil then, we await a better world - one without fear, without greed, without war. We wait for deliverance, and justice. We wait for a champion. We will wait for word that gods grow good.”\n\nHope that world gets here soon…<br />

Mimir is helping us figure out why Baldur of the Aesir came to our door. “I know what you are… you know what I want”—who does he think we are?<br />
*38196*<br />
Mimir on Baldur<br />
*38197*<br />
On Magni and Modi<br />
*38198*<br />
Magni and Modi, the sons of Thor, are helping their uncle Baldur find us. Strong, dangerous, foolish. Mimir has a story about them and Hrungnir—ask later.<br />
*38199*<br />
Baldur and Odin<br />
*38200*<br />
Mimir thinks Baldur is tracking us for Odin, who wants to go “where he cannot reach”… but WE can?<br />
*38201*<br />
Odin and Jötunheim<br />
*38202*<br />
If Odin and Baldur are trying to get to Jötunheim, and they think WE are the answer, how did they know that before we even knew we had to go there? Mimir insists this makes sense.<br />
*38203*<br />
Odin’s Prophecies<br />
*38204*<br />
Odin collects prophecies…tries to control fate by knowing the future. Maybe he thinks we’ll pose a threat someday. Or at least he knows we’re looking for a way to Jötunheim…<br />
*38205*<br />
Serpent’s History<br />
*38206*<br />
Jörmungandr the World Serpent has already fought Thor in Ragnarök, and was knocked back in time to now. That, or Mimir is insane.<br />
*38207*<br />
Odin’s interests in Jötunheim—he fears the Giants at Ragnarök, and wants their prophecies of the future. (Giants are the best at prophecy?) Ask Mimir later why they call Odin “Lord of the Hanged”…<br />
*38208*<br />
Odin and the Jötnar<br />
*38209*<br />
Flight of the Jötnar<br />
*38210*<br />
The Giants left Midgard to escape Thor’s slaughter—most likely their work destroying the bridges to travel there. What did they do to make the Jötunheim tower in the lake disappear?<br />
*38211*<br />
Odin spent nine days dead, hanging from Yggdrasil, the World Tree, for the wisdom of life and death and destiny. He goes REALLY far to get what he wants..!<br />
*38212*<br />
The Hanged God<br />
*38213*<br />
Nothing Is Written<br />
*38214*<br />
Odin thinks he can beat fate and change Ragnarök, even though the Serpent’s already been through it. Father doesn’t think much of fate either—“another lie told by the gods”—so they have that in common…<br />
*38215*<br />
Father kept those blades hidden under the house. If his old life is such a burden, why’d he keep them around?<br />

Frigg and Freya<br />
*38219*<br />
“Frigg” was Freya all along?? Baldur’s mother, Odin’s wife… it’s so hard to imagine her with the Aesir gods… but I’ve seen it with my own eyes now!<br />
*38220*<br />
When the Giants trusted someone enough to help them travel the realms, they’d put Bifröst crystals in their eyes. Týr had them, and so does Mimir.<br />

Mimir on the Dead<br />
*38224*<br />
Even Mimir doesn’t know why there’s so many dead men walking around Midgard… but he suspects Odin’s meddling, and maybe the Valkyries.<br />
*38225*<br />
Brok and Sindri made Thor’s Hammer, Mjölnir. It made their reputation… but it also seems like they can’t live it down.<br />
*38226*<br />
Mjölnir the Hammer<br />
*38227*<br />
The Huldra Brothers<br />
*38228*<br />
Brok and Sindri are dwarves, but for some reason people call them the “Huldra Brothers” after the beautiful forest sprites. Apparently I’m too young to be told why.<br />
*38229*<br />
So Mom was “Laufey the Just”—she really was protecting people, before she had me. They even knew of her in Asgard! I’m so proud of her…<br />
*38230*<br />

*38231*<br />
Freya’s Spirit<br />

You’re still here? I told you to LEAVE. These are MY treasures, and you can’t have them. The best stuff is in my storeroom, anyways. But don’t even THINK about going there. That place is well-guarded, I made sure of that.<br />
Just leave me be. I don’t need you; I don’t need anybody. Certainly not any of Ivaldi’s stupid sons warning me about the dangers of greed. I only need look in my newly-acquired Vanir Mirror to see what it does to my skin. But I don’t care. My treasure makes me feel safe, and it warms me from the inside, like the breath of a dragon.<br />
Get lost.”<br />

*39576*<br />
[[D:Flyer00,Flyer10:180::::::Combat]]<br />
Nightmares are dangerous in numbers, but die easily. Consider defeating them first to make encounters easier to finish.<br />
*39577*<br />
[[D:Flyer00,Flyer10:383::::::Combat]]<br />
Using the Spear of Chaos attack against Nightmares is very effective!<br />
*39578*<br />
Lava and Magma Nightmares are explosive and dangerous. Ranged attacks allow you to safely detonate them from a distance.<br />
*39579*<br />
Cursed and Corrupted Nightmares possess other enemies, buffing them. STUN or kill possessed enemies to remove the Nightmare.<br />
*39580*<br />
[[D:Flyer00,Flyer10:295::::::Combat]]<br />

Hits to an Ancient’s body are deflected and cause no damage.<br />
*39582*<br />
[[D:Golem00,Golem10,Golem20,Golem30:180::::::Combat]]<br />
Ancients must reveal their hearts in order to attack their enemies. The heart is vulnerable to ranged attacks.<br />
*39583*<br />
[[D:Golem00,Golem10,Golem20,Golem30:180::::::Combat]]<br />

*39584*<br />
[[D:Golem00,Golem10,Golem20,Golem30:180::::::Combat]]<br />

[[D:Jotunn00,Jotunn10:187::::::Combat]]<br />
Ogres are strong and fast; beware their shockwave smash attacks, which can be avoided with a well-timed dodge.<br />
*39588*<br />
[[D:Jotunn00,Jotunn10:187::::::Combat]]<br />
Ogres attack indiscriminately; use this to your advantage. Their attacks often hit smaller enemies, creating opportunities before they recover.<br />
*39589*<br />
[[D:Jotunn00,Jotunn10:187::::::Combat]]<br />
A well-aimed axe throw at an Ogre’s head before or after it attacks is sometimes all it takes to break the Ogre’s momentum and focus.<br />
*39590*<br />
[[D:Jotunn00,Jotunn10:187::::::Combat]]<br />
After shockwave attacks, Ogres are momentarily stationary and easy to attack while they recover.<br />

*39593*<br />
[[D:Witch20,Witch10,Witch00:115::::::Combat]]<br />
When surrounded by their protective magic, Revenants evade most attacks. Atreus’s arrows can remove this magic, leaving them temporarily vulnerable to all attacks.<br />
*39594*<br />
[[D:Witch20,Witch10,Witch00:115::::::Combat]]<br />
Steer clear of hazards that Revenants create; they can damage Kratos and apply status effects.<br />
*39595*<br />
[[D:Witch20,Witch10,Witch00:115::::::Combat]]<br />
Revenants are most dangerous when encountered with other enemies. Defeating them first can make the encounter easier to handle.<br />
*39596*<br />
[[D:Witch20,Witch10,Witch00:115::::::Combat]]<br />
Block or dodge to the side to avoid Revenants’ raking fissure attacks. The fissures will navigate obstacles and try to find you.<br />
*39597*<br />
[[D:Witch20,Witch10,Witch00:383::::::Combat]]<br />
Avoid the Hel-Revenant’s ice breath attack by all means. This attack can freeze you, leaving you vulnerable to enemies.<br />
*39598*<br />
[[D:Wulver00:180::::::Combat]]<br />
When a Wulver howls, they enter a frenzy and their attacks become more focused and dangerous. Try a more defensive approach, and wait for openings to attack.<br />
*39599*<br />
[[D:Wulver00:180::::::Combat]]<br />
Wulver are aggressive and relentless. If they aren’t yet frenzied, try fighting back with an aggressive, relentless approach… it can be more effective than a defensive approach.<br />
*39600*<br />
[[D:Wulver00:180::::::Combat]]<br />
Some Wulver attacks can be avoided, leaving them vulnerable. Try luring them into walls to STUN them.<br />
*39601*<br />
[[D:Wulver00:180::::::Combat]]<br />
Parrying a Wulver’s melee swipes is an effective strategy and can be used to break their attack momentum.<br />
*39602*<br />
[[D:Wulver00:180::::::Combat]]<br />
Beware frenzied Wulver that are stationary and down on all fours. They can lunge and grab Kratos, mauling him. Dodge this attack!<br />
*39603*<br />
[[D:Draugr00:267::::::Combat]]<br />
Dual Wielding Draugr will attack quickly. Parry to break their combo.<br />
*39604*<br />
[[D:Draugr00:267::::::Combat]]<br />
Draugr with leg energy are hard to hit. Wait for them to come to you and parry their attacks.<br />
*39605*<br />
[[D:Draugr00:267::::::Combat]]<br />
When Draugr with chest energy are powered up, avoid hitting them or you’ll be knocked back by an explosion.<br />

Stranger<br />
*39624*<br />
A strange man covered in tattoos came to the house and attacked Father. It must’ve been some fight… everything’s broken! Father said I wasn’t ready earlier, but something about killing this stranger changed his mind, I guess. Who was he? What did he want with us? We’re nobodies.<br />
*39625*<br />
The Goddess Freya<br />
*39626*<br />
The Witch of the Woods was the goddess Freya the whole time! No wonder she’s so good at magic. Father got REALLY mad at her when he found out. He always tells me that gods are nothing but trouble, but Freya’s always been nice to us. Maybe not all gods are bad?<br />

“It is done. Asgard’s defenses are impenetrable. All means of access have been cut off, save those in Odin’s power. The plague of the dead will not touch us, nor shall we fear any Vanir aggression. Word of this must reach noble Thor, for the time approaches for his part in the Allfather’s plan.”<br />
—The Raven Keeper<br />
*40039*<br />
Svartalfheim Sealed<br />
*40040*<br />
“The realm of the dwarves is secured. For a promise of security from the rovers of Hel, they have made Asgard custodian to their borders. Now the Vanir will have no hope of Svartalfheim’s aid, thanks to Odin’s foresight. The Elves remain sufficiently distracted. All plans proceed.”<br />
—The Raven Keeper<br />
*40041*<br />
Vanaheim Sealed<br />
*40042*<br />
“Our vengeance upon the Vanir gods is at hand. Their realm is isolated by Odin’s spell-craft, and infiltrated presently by the God of Thunder himself. Thor’s absence may be long-felt by our folk, but we will keep up the Allfather’s work in Midgard. Our priority remains Jötunheim.”<br />
—The Raven Keeper<br />
*40043*<br />
The Serpent<br />
*40044*<br />
“The Serpent cannot be spoken to, but his belligerence towards the Aesir is unmistakeable. The destruction of Týr’s temple is infeasible while he remains; however, his presence has caused the Lake of Nine to submerge it completely. Therefore, the larger aim of fettering realm travel is still achieved.”<br />
—The Raven Keeper<br />
*40045*<br />
The Missing Tower<br />
*40046*<br />
“The search for any trace of the Jötunheim tower remains fruitless. Not only Midgard, but in all realms in which the tower once stood, there is now only a mystic echo of what was. Had it been destroyed by might, some remnant would remain, but this magical vestige suggests magical means. It must exist somewhere. Our horde of loyal spies continues to grow. I cannot doubt someday we will find it, wherever it may be hidden.”<br />

Traveler Scroll 4<br />
*40056*<br />
Of course! It’s “Jötunheim”… it’s always about Jötunheim, and it always comes back to Odin pulling the strings. He has a whole army devoted to finding “The Lost Path”… and here we are trying to find it first.<br />

Mimir and Odin<br />
*40065*<br />
Revenge of Hrimthur<br />
*40066*<br />
The Aesir finally met their match with the Vanir, and the Long War only ended when Mimir convinced Freya to marry Odin.<br />
*40067*<br />
Did Odin love Freya? Mimir thought so, for a while… but once Odin learned her magic, his old obsession with Jötunheim led him down a dark path.<br />
*40068*<br />
When Freya finally left Odin, he cursed her, trapping her in Midgard and stealing her Warrior Spirit. Since she can’t fight, she has to live alone in the woods for safety.<br />
*40069*<br />
Týr brought Odin to Jötunheim to make peace with the Giants, but Odin’s deceptions were exposed and he was cursed to never return. As Thor slaughtered the Giants of Midgard, Týr helped the survivors escape, and cut off access to their realm.<br />
*40070*<br />
When Hrungnir the Brawler fell on Thor, only young Magni and Modi had the strength to free their father. Magni got the credit, so Modi became a jerk? (Nah, they were both jerks.)<br />
*40071*<br />
Mimir used to work for a faerie king in a faraway land, until he made too much mischief. He’s been using his wits to survive for a long time…<br />
*40072*<br />
Mimir introduced himself to Odin with a “mystic well of knowledge” that made him rip out his own eye. Their relationship sounds complicated.<br />
*40073*<br />
After a long time advising Odin, Mimir came to believe he could only serve Odin by containing him and serving peace, but Odin lost trust in him and imprisoned him in the tree.<br />
*40074*<br />
Hrimthur, son of Thamur the Giant Stone Mason, disguised himself and built a wall around Asgard. Mimir thinks he built in a weakness and told only Freya about it.<br />
