Mother gave me this journal and made me promise to use it. So… I guess I just write everything down now? Should be plenty of time while Father chops down the trees she marked. Been a long while since I’ve gone anywhere with him… but this is what she wanted, so I guess we both better get used to it.__
*674*__
Hunt with Atreus__
*675*__
Father’s taking me hunting before we start the journey to the mountain. Mother’s wishes were clear—we let the pyre burn, then take her ashes to the highest peak in the realms. I’ve got to show him I’m ready and I won’t get sick anymore. Mom wanted us to scatter them together… I won’t let her down!__
*676*__
Find the Deer__
*677*__
Can’t let that deer get away, time to finish what we started.__
*678*__
Return to the house__
*679*__
Wow, Father and I killed a troll. I always knew he was tough, but I never knew he could move like that. Time to head home to recover.__
*680*__
Continue towards the mountain__
*681*__
Father and I have left home and are going to the highest peak in the realm to spread mothers ashes.__
*682*__
Escape the ruins__
*683*__
Father beat the stranger at our door, but we’re not safe there anymore. Ready or not, we’re heading for the mountain. \n__
First we need to escape this creepy place. Where are all the people?__
*684*__
Continue towards the mountain__
*685*__
We survived the monsters and traps that were in the ruins and found the mountain again. Now we are back on the path.__
*686*__
Hunt with Atreus__
*687*__
On another hunt. I think Father is trying to take my mind off of what happened before. I won’t let him down.__
*688*__
Find Atreus__
*689*__
Tracking the boar, I got separated from Father. How’d that happen? I’m always the one trying to keep up.__
*690*__
Follow the Witch__
*691*__
I shot the boar, but it was a friendly magic boar and this nice Witch’s friend! We need to help her save his life…__
*692*__
Collect the white-petaled flower__
*693*__
The Witch sent me to the garden out back to gather herbs for the boar. I hope she can heal him.__
*694*__
Return to Atreus__
*695*__
We did everything we could for the Boar. When Father is done talking to the Witch, it’ll be time to get back to our journey.__
*696*__
Return to the Witch__
*697*__
Time to bid farewell to the Witch and get back on the path… but I can’t believe I dropped Mother’s knife.__
*698*__
Get to the boat__
*699*__
The nice Witch drew protection staves on us and showed us a way to reach the mountain by boat. Row towards daylight, she said…__
*700*__
Boat towards daylight__
*701*__
Is every witch’s cave full of monsters and treasure chests? I don’t know any other witches, so I guess that’s not weird. Anyways, we found the boat, so we should head towards daylight.__
*702*__
Follow the Witch__
*703*__
The Black Breath—some sort of nasty-smelling magic—stopped us at the entrance to the mountain. The friendly Witch from the woods appeared and told us we need the Light of Alfheim, and she’s going to help us get it…__
*704*__
Realign the bridge__
*705*__
To get the light we need to dispel the Black Breath, we need to go to Alfheim. To get to Alfheim, we need to realign the bridge so we can use the Realm Travel Room.__
*706*__
Follow the Witch__
*707*__
We realigned the bridge and I think we are all set to continue our journey. I’m glad we have the Witch of the Woods here to help.__
*708*__
Travel to Alfheim__
*709*__
I’ve heard stories about Alfheim and the Light Elves from Mother, but I never thought I’d actually get to go there myself. Our goal is to find The Light and dispel the Black Breath, but I can’t wait to see what going to another realm is like.__
*710*__
The Light of Alfheim__
*711*__
Capture the Light of Alfheim and dispel the Black Breath to reach the mountain.__
*712*__
Get to the Ringed Temple__
*713*__
The Light Elves and Dark Elves are fighting an endless war over the light we need. Father doesn’t want to get involved, but we need some of the Bifröst light for ourselves if we’re ever going to fulfill Mom’s final wish. They cut off the light bridge to the temple, so we’re finding another way in.__
*714*__
Free the boat__
*715*__
We ran into our pal Sindri along the beach and also found this boat tangled up in hive tendrils. If we find a way to dislodge it, we can explore further into Alfheim__
*716*__
Between The Realms__
*717*__
What lies off the path of the World Tree?__
*718*__
Find a way into the temple__
*719*__
The Light Elves and Dark Elves are fighting an endless war over the light we need. Father doesn’t want to get involved, but we need some of the Bifröst light for ourselves if we’re ever going to fulfill Mom’s final wish. The Elves are trying to keep us out, but we’re looking for a way in.__
*720*__
Reactivate the Ringed Temple bridge__
*721*__
We found a light bridge leading into the temple, but as soon as we got close it went out. There has to be a way to reactivate it, time to start looking for clues.__
*722*__
Go back up to the Ringed Temple bridge__
*723*__
We reactivated the main bridge. Now all we have to do is get back up and cross it. Should be easy, right?__
*724*__
Find another way into the temple__
*725*__
Well, the front door was locked. Guess I should have seen that coming. Time to look for another way into the Temple.__
*726*__
Find a way into the hive__
*727*__
We’re in the temple where they keep the Light of Alfheim, but it’s all covered up. We need to find a way to free it so we can get what we need for the Bifröst.__
*728*__
Destroy the hive and claim the Light__
*729*__
So, yea, of course we need to bring this hive down. Things sure seem dire in Alfheim these days. We need the light and the only way we are going to get it is by destroying this hive. Maybe we’ll end up helping the Light Elves in the process.__
*730*__
Find a way out of the temple__
*731*__
We have the Light. Let’s get out of this place.__
*732*__
Return to the boat__
*733*__
The Light Elves have returned to Alfheim! I know that this wasn’t our original goal, but I feel pretty good about it. Now, we need to find a way back to our boat which is on the other side of the lake. We’ll have to go through the trench to get there.__
*734*__
Return to Týr’s Temple__
*735*__
Now that we have the Light of Alfheim captured in the Bifröst, we can return to Midgard and continue our journey to the highest peak.__
*736*__
Realm travel back to Midgard__
*737*__
Wow… what a trip. We destroyed the Dark Elf Hive, ended the war, Father disappeared into the Light for what seemed like forever and I had to fight off an entire swarm of Dark Elves. So much has happened since Mom died… but we can’t lose sight of our goal to spread her ashes. Time to head back to Midgard and use the Light on the Black Breath.__
*738*__
Investigate the dead Giant__
*739*__
Our journey continues! Step one: get a piece of the chisel from the dead Giant’s hammer.__
*740*__
Retrieve a piece of the chisel__
*741*__
We’re here and its cold. The Giant is huge, so it should be easy enough to make our way over there and get a piece of his hammer… although by this point, I know that nothing is as easy as it seems.__
*742*__
Find a way to break the ice__
*743*__
The magic chisel we need a piece of is buried under a lot of ice (and a dead Giant stone mason). Father’s got a plan to reach it. I hope it works!__
*744*__
Retrieve a piece of the chisel__
*745*__
That chisel is huge, so we’ll have to carve a little piece off of it to take with us.__
*746*__
Return to the boat__
*747*__
We got to the chisel’s tip, but Thor’s awful sons Magni and Modi attacked us. Father put his axe through Magni’s face and Modi ran away, but I got so angry I almost got sick again. I must fight it! We just need the travel rune to Jötunheim now, and we can finally scatter Mom’s ashes…__
*748*__
Find a way out of Helheim__
*749*__
I’ve really messed everything up. I killed Modi for what he said about Mom, but Father got angry and we kept arguing all the way to the summit. Then Baldur found us, and in the fighting we destroyed our path to Jötunheim. Now we’ve been sucked into the far side of Hel, and somehow we need to get out of here before we freeze.__
*750*__
Use the ship__
*751*__
Maybe this ship is my ticket out of Helheim.__
*752*__
Free the Ship__
*753*__
Going to need to free the ship if I want to make it out of here__
*754*__
Escape Helheim__
*755*__
The boat works just like those flying lanterns in the mountain! If we can free it, and keep it in one piece, maybe we can sail out of Hel alive! \n__
Also—Freya is Baldur’s mother!?__
*756*__
Return to Týr’s Vault__
*757*__
Father told me…. he’s a god, and so am I. I guess not knowing was making me sick. He seems so ashamed, I guess because of how much he hates gods… but Mom always said some of them were good. Anyway—back to Týr’s vault to find the Black Rune!__
*758*__
Go to Týr’s Vault__
*759*__
Of course Týr wouldn’t just leave the Black Rune sitting out. I know it’s a vault, but this thing has some serious security.__
*760*__
Escape the trap__
*761*__
Well this isn’t good…__
*762*__
Show Týr’s key plans to Brok__
*763*__
These plans seem to lay out how to create a special key.__
*764*__
Locate Týr’s mysterious door__
*765*__
Brok and Sindri made us the key to enter Týr’s hidden chamber. I have a feeling it’s that door downstairs by the water, on the round part of the temple. If it was important enough for Týr to hide, maybe there’s something inside that can give us a new path to Jötunheim!__
*766*__
Go back up and flip the temple__
*767*__
Let’s flip this temple!__
*769*__
It has to be down here somewhere.__
*897*__
Enter the Völunder Mines__
*898*__
Brok just asked us to find his Alchemist friend, Andvari, at the Völunder Mines. Father isn’t big on helping people for no reward, but Brok DID just give us the entry stone to the Mines… Maybe we should look into it?__
*899*__
Find the Dwarf with a green ring__
*900*__
Brok isn’t sure his friend is still alive, but at least we know he’s wearing a green ring. I’ll keep an eye out for it while Father is “gathering resources.”__
*903*__
Retrieve the severed hand__
*904*__
We killed the Soul Eater and found Andvari’s ring! And his hand. But… no body. We should look at the ring and make sure it’s Andvari’s.__
*907*__
Return to Brok__
*908*__
I hope Brok isn’t too upset about Andvari being dead. I’m not sure exactly what he needed him for, but maybe he’ll give us a reward for finding the ring?__
*909*__
Deus Ex Malachite__
*910*__
Help Brok find his dead friend Andvari__
*911*__
Meet Brok at the Landsuther Mines__
*912*__
Brok thinks he knows where we might find his dead friend Andvari (the Dwarf whose hand we found). He’ll explain more if we meet him at the Landsuther Mines.__
*913*__
Search for Andvari’s hammer__
*914*__
So, that ring we found: Andvari’s soul is trapped inside! Apparently, he stashed it in there so the Soul Eater wouldn’t eat it. Brok wants us to use him to find his fancy hammer. Andvari seems grouchy about it, but I guess I would be too if I were trapped in a ring and some strangers were stealing my stuff.__
*915*__
Return to Brok__
*916*__
With Andvari’s help (finally), we found his hammer! For a soul trapped in a ring, Andvari sure is talkative. I bet Brok will be happy to have them both!__
*917*__
Fáfnir’s Hoard__
*918*__
Help Sindri find Fáfnir’s whetstone__
*919*__
Head to Fáfnir’s storeroom__
*920*__
Sindri told us about the Dwarf Fáfnir who was renowned for his collection of (stolen) treasures. A treasure-filled storeroom sounds like it might be worth a look. Sindri asked us to keep an eye out for a special whetstone from Niflheim. I just hope nobody got there before us…__
*921*__
Use entry stone on the pedestal__
*922*__
We made it inside the Storeroom, but all the rooms are locked. Seems like Fáfnir was pretty paranoid about people stealing his stuff. Although I guess since WE’RE here to steal his stuff, he had reason to be. Hopefully Sindri’s entry stone will unlock the first room.__
*923*__
Search for the whetstone__
*924*__
The first room is open! Maybe we’ll find another entry stone inside. We should search every room in here for Sindri’s whetstone… and anything else that looks useful. Hopefully the Reavers didn’t pick this place clean.__
*925*__
Talk to the Reaver Spirit__
*926*__
We’re in the last room, and we haven’t found a whetstone yet. But there’s a spirit here. Maybe he knows something?__
*927*__
Return to Sindri__
*928*__
When he was alive, the Reaver Spirit found the whetstone we were looking for… and then his son stabbed him in the back and took it! Father took the dagger from his back, and now we’re bringing it back to Sindri. Maybe he’ll be able to use it to find his whetstone.__
*929*__
Family Business__
*930*__
Retrieve the whetstone.__
*931*__
Head to the Northri Stronghold__
*932*__
Sindri used the sigil on the knife we brought him to trace the Reavers to the Northri Stronghold. That’s probably where they brought their haul from the storeroom, including that whetstone he keeps going on about. We should check it out and see what we can find.__
*933*__
Find a way to open the grate__
*934*__
Looks like these Reavers were just as paranoid as Fáfnir. There’s a giant metal grate blocking our path. Maybe we can open it using the giant water wheel?__
*935*__
Explore deeper into the stronghold__
*936*__
What was this place? We haven’t found much so far besides corrupted Reavers. We should go deeper into the stronghold.__
*937*__
Investigate the reaver ship__
*938*__
We found a wrecked Reaver ship, and it looks like things didn’t end well for them. We should get down there and take a closer look.__
*939*__
Return to Sindri__
*940*__
I can’t stop thinking about how this Reaver killed his own father. Why are people so greedy sometimes? At least we found the whetstone Sindri wanted! I wonder what he’ll make us with it… once he finishes cleaning the blood off…__
*941*__
CUT - Inform the Brother of His Own Death__
*942*__
The Fallen Warrior said we could find his brother near Lookout Tower__
*943*__
Return to the Fallen Warrior__
*944*__
We found the brother and told him he was dead… it went poorly. Time to return to the Fallen Warrior.__
*945*__
The Anatomy of Hope__
*946*__
Maybe we can talk to Mom again…__
*947*__
Recover Gullveig’s Bones__
*948*__
Bones Collected: %d of %d \n__
This ghost wants us to find this dead lady’s bones and bring them back to the rest of her body. She’s missing both hands and her head. It’s pretty disgusting! But if it works, maybe it’ll be worth it…__
*949*__
Return Gullveig’s Bones__
*950*__
We have all the bones, now we just need to place them with the skeletal corpse next to the spirit guy’s body and see what happens. I wonder what this maiden is like… and why they scattered her body parts.__
*951*__
Speak to the spirit__
*952*__
We’ve recovered all the scattered bones of the maiden. Time to bring them back to the spirit and see if he can make good on his word.__
*953*__
Kill Gullveig__
*954*__
Father was right—__
*955*__
Hammer Fall__
*956*__
Bring down the smaller Thor statue on the island off Veithurgard__
*957*__
Destroy the statue of Thor__
*958*__
We met the ghost of a man who devoted his life to Thor, but now he’s turned against him. He wants us to destroy a statue… not the big one in the Lake of Nine, but a smaller one on an island outside the lake, adorned in emerald. As much as Father hates gods, I bet we’ll help him out.__
*959*__
Return to the Disciple of Thor__
*960*__
Now that we brought down the statue we should probably head back to that spirit and let him know. I also have to remind Father that we were allowed to loot the grave near the statue.__
*961*__

*3567*__
The Jötunheim travel gate is missing its crystal.__
*3568*__
Talk to Brok and Sindri__
*3569*__
The trip to Jötunheim failed because we don’t have a travel crystal. We could use Mimir’s eyes if he only had them both, but Odin ran off with one. We’re going to see what Brok and Sindri know about it…__
*3571*__
Return to the Serpent’s horn in Midgard__
*3572*__
We need Mimir’s eye to travel to Jötunheim. Odin stole his eye and hid it in the statue of Thor. Jörmungandr the World Serpent ate the statue. So, I guess we have to ask the Serpent if we can have it back…?__
*3573*__
Find Mimir’s eye__
*3574*__

Break the chains__
*3583*__
The temple is chained down.__
*3584*__

*3585*__
Now that the temple is upside down, maybe we have access to mysterious object that Týr took so much trouble to hide.__
*3586*__

Now that the tower is restored, we should be able to use the realm travel table to reach Jötunheim.__
*3588*__

This is strange…Týr’s secret area surrounds the Realm Travel Room, with an upside-down version of it under the floor. And we can see a magical field just like the one the Black Rune was in, but we have to figure out a way to reach it. I wonder what’s inside and what it has to do with Jötunheim!__
*3600*__
Return to the Realm Travel Room__

Oh, and apparently GODS are looking for us—Baldur of Asgard and his nephews, the Sons of Thor! I’m so confused. But now we’re heading back to the Witch to see if her magic can wake up Mimir’s head.__

They’re hard to describe… but I’m sure the brothers can figure out what to do with them.__

Mother always said Týr was among the most beloved of the gods. Mortals would sail from all over the world to visit his temple and bring him offerings.

I had heard whispers of a Dwarf King who was capturing dragons. I didn’t think it was possible until we found one chained by three magic shrines. I know they can be dangerous, but it just feels so wrong to keep them chained up. The three shrines in the area are what is keeping Otr in captivity.

It was no accident Mom sent us to Jötunheim. She knew everything that was going to happen… everything that HAD to happen. Mother was a Giant.  The last “guardian” in Midgard. I guess she couldn’t tell us… but now she wanted us to know. She wanted me to see I have a destiny, but I’m not really sure what it all means yet. Maybe we’ll head home now, or maybe we’ll see who else needs our help. I’m ready for whatever is next.__

*20031*__
Complete__
*20052*__
A mighty Giant made of frost and stone. Looks like he had a huge fight with Aesir and Vanir gods. He battles Thor… and it looks like they both lose.__
*20053*__
“Hrungnir the Brawler”—a head of stone, but the mind of a child. Odin tricks him into getting drunk and rowdy in Asgard. Thor smashes his head, but he ends up crushed, and everybody laughs. Aesir are the worst.__
*20054*__
This one’s confusing. Ymir’s the first Giant, and things spring from his body… not just other Giants, but wind, trees, sun… maggots that turn into Dwarves maybe? Then Odin kills him… but where did he come from?__
*20055*__
So Ymir came from fire and ice, and all lands and creatures came from his flesh… including the Aesir, who then slew him to create “order” (in other words, to take control). The first Giant was Odin’s first victim…__
*20056*__
Hrungnir__
*20083*__
Ymir__
*20084*__
Thamur__
*20085*__
The greatest stone mason and one of the biggest Giants of all. He argues with his son Hrimthur, strikes him, and gets lost looking for him. Thor chisels Thamur in the head and crushes a whole town!__
*20086*__
Thamur was building a wall around Jötunheim to protect Giants from the Aesir. Did it ever get finished?__
*20087*__
Wolf-Giants! Sköll chases the Sun and Hati the Moon. What happens when they catch their prey? Looks like a massive fight—Odin, Thor, the World Serpent… could it be…?__
*20088*__
Sköll and Hati__
*20089*__
Ragnarök! Odin knows the prophecy and sent them anyway, cause Mimir says he’s always trying to control everything. Until then, they’re the “Bringers of Day and Night” that keep the Sun and Moon moving.__
*20090*__
A legendary Giant huntress—one of Mother’s favorites. She could hunt birds, boars, deer, anything! Her father taught her how… but what happened to him…?__
*20091*__
Skaði__
*20092*__
Her father Thiazi could take the form of any creature. Odin got jealous and tricked Skaði into hunting an eagle that was Thiazi in disguise! Is she still out there somewhere, under the frozen mountains?__
*20093*__
Bergelmir__
*20094*__
A Giant King with many, MANY children. Looks like he arrived on a sea of blood, and when he died he left a sea of tears. Dead, but not murdered (for once).__
*20095*__
Bergelmir and his queen survived the flood of Ymir’s blood, and founded Jötunheim. They did NOT seek revenge, except to live and see his kind prosper. “Bergelmir the Beloved”—a happy ending!__
*20096*__
Gróa__
*20097*__
A Giant Sorceress, and a powerful seer. Slain by Odin… did he steal her book of visions?__
*20098*__
Called “The Knowledge Keeper”, Gróa was the first to have a vision of Ragnarök. She trusted Odin as a friend. BAD IDEA.__
*20099*__
Jörmungandr__
*20100*__
The World Serpent spans all the waters of Midgard… maybe the only one big enough to beat Thor? I still can’t believe we met him!__
*20101*__
Now that I’ve heard Mimir talk to Jörmungandr in his ancient tongue, I wonder if I could figure out how to do it…__
*20102*__
Odin plotted to destroy Starkaðr after hearing Mimir praise him as a potential leader of Giants. They spread rumors and gathered a mob, and when he surrendered to clear his name, Thor murdered him.__
*20103*__
A Giant with eight arms, swinging four swords… until Thor chopped him up. Why did the gods gang up on him?__
*20104*__
Starkaðr__
*20105*__
Surtr__
*20106*__
An ancient Fire Giant of Muspelheim. He forged a sword of fire, and fought—or will fight—Thor and Odin.__
*20107*__
Prophecy says “Surtr the Brave” will die at Ragnarök but take Asgard with him. Mimir says it’s part of a grand cycle of death and rebirth, and Surtr accepts his fate.__

*21381*__
Survive the gauntlet of realms__
*21382*__
This does not look good…__
*21391*__
Defeat Baldur__
*21392*__
We got Mimir’s eye back, but Baldur attacked Jörmungandr and he spat us out near the dead Stone Mason. Now Freya’s here and Baldur’s in a rage and everyone’s having it out. I don’t think we’re all walking away from this…__
*21393*__
Return to the Realm Travel Room__
*21394*__
Return to Sindri__
*21395*__
It’s over now. The spell on Baldur was broken by the mistletoe arrow holding up my quiver (of all things)! Freya brought back Thamur the Stone Mason to stop us, but Jörmungandr helped us beat him. We beat Baldur together, and we would have let him go, but he tried to kill Freya… and I guess she was alright with that, but we weren’t. Now he’s dead, and she’s really angry, and I don’t know how to feel about any of it. But one thing’s for sure: we’re going to Jötunheim!__
*21396*__
We sealed the three realm tears in Niflheim, and boy, it was not easy. I don’t think Sindri will believe us, but I can’t wait to tell him.__

“From darkness keep safe the Light”\n\nMore like trying to keep the other Elves from getting it…__
*25609*__
“Until gods grow good”\n\nI guess he means never. But maybe…__
*25610*__
“Leave them in peace”\n\nA message from Týr? Does he mean the Giants?__
*25640*__
“Duraþrór”\n\nA stag of the World Tree who watches the gates of Jötunheim (where Giants come from). This really IS the Giants’ mountain!__
*25641*__
“Ignite”\n\nI was able to light this “Brazier” by reading the runes. Some kind of spell, maybe? I bet there are more of these around the Lake of Nine. Were there more people here, before this was a lake? Where did they all go? So many questions… I wish we could ask the World Serpent!__
*25642*__
“To Njörd we offer back the sea’s bounty.”\n\nFor a god, Njörd doesn’t sound too bad.__
*25643*__
“Death Inside”\n\nThis must be old. There’s plenty of death outside, too.__
*25644*__
“Hræzlyr”\n\nWho or what would be named “terror”…?__
*25645*__
“Muspelheim”\n”Gauntlet of Surtr”\n\nThe ancient realm of fire! Now that we have the travel rune, we can go anytime and see what new challenges await.__
*25647*__
“Thought is faster than wind”\n\nTýr’s testing our minds in here…__
*25652*__
“Hunting Death”\n\nHmm… Does this mean someone died during a hunt, or they were LITERALLY hunting Death? Sounds rough either way.__
*25654*__
“Don’t wake him”\n\nI’m REALLY getting tired of being told what to do.__
*25662*__
“Njörd was here”\n\nTrying to imagine Mimir drinking with a Vanir god. Actually not that hard. I wonder if Freya was ever here…__
*25663*__
“Trade Grounds”\n\nFound what used to be a marketplace where gods and Giants would meet and trade. Must have been before the war…__
*25699*__
“Death to the Raven God, Lord of the Hanged”\n\nShe really doesn’t like Odin very much.__
*25704*__
“Welcome Jötnar”\n\nThe Jötnar had a settlement here? Giants, so close to home! But… how long ago?__
*25707*__
“Turn back, Aesir”\n\nI hope those are magic runes… words won’t keep the Aesir away.__
*25708*__
I guess Ymir lived a long time ago. Wonder what happened to them…__
*25709*__
“Jötnar only__
and also Dwarves”\n\nThe Mountain was a stronghold of the Giants in Midgard. After they left, the Dwarves mined it dry.__
*25710*__
“The eternal war for the Light endures”\n\nThe same Light we need for the Bifröst, of course.__
*25715*__
“Niflheim”\n”Fog and Fortune”\n\nA misty realm of treasure and traps! Well, we have the rune to go explore…__
*25716*__
“Seiðr níðings upon all who trespass”\n\n…but we’re invited here… right?__

A new age for Dwarves dawns here—no mere miners but masters of iron, whose greatest craft is the future itself!”__
*31132*__
To See Her Again__
*31156*__
“The death of my daughter turned me into a broken man, but one of the Lake Spirits tells me I can find some peace. His master’s a powerful seiðr witch, and he says she’ll reunite me with my sweet Iona! I just need to find her bones. Don’t know why someone would go to the trouble a scatterin’ bones across the Lake of Nine, but the task is naught to me. I’d go to Helheim for a chance to see my daughter again.”__
*31162*__
Death to the Gods__
*31163*__
“I was foolish to think a simple apprentice could survive on his own out in these harsh lands. My supplies dwindle, and the Draugr are more numerous than I had anticipated. But my parents deserve vengeance, and I will not rest until they have it. They only wanted to honor the gods, and died with nothing to show for it. The gods… they are not wise. They are not just or good. They are not to be worshiped or idolized. They are no better than man. I pray for their deaths.__
I realize the irony. Who am I praying to? What god answers the prayer of ’death to the gods’? And still, I pray for one who would purify this world of their evil and send them to the same Hel that awaits the rest of us.”__
*31164*__
Shipwrecked__
*31643*__
“Until today, I’ve always thought the Lake of Nine as a desolate, cursed place. And for the three ships caught in the recent storm, that notion holds true. But for this simple scavenger? Their loss is my gain. I found their fool of a captain on one of the beaches. He was a broken man, in both spirit and body.  I gave him Hel’s kindness, but not before I filled my pockets with all the Hacksilver I could carry.__
The captain held an Offering to Týr, which is all well and good… But to neglect Thor? What kind of experienced seafarer neglects the God of Thunder?”__

“With each passing day, the dead continue to rise. Their resurrection occurs in various forms. Draugr, once merely an occasional sighting, have spread in shocking numbers across Midgard and beyond. The icy bodies of re-animated Reavers (commonly known as ‘Hel-Walkers’) remain a mystery—what causes their resurrection? Finally, the various spirits throughout the Lake of Nine. They appear harmless… which is more than can be said of the Draugr and Hel-Walkers. The ones I’ve encountered show a single-minded determination in some task or desire that keeps them bound to this realm. What will happen to them should they achieve their goal? All have offered some form of reward. Speaking with these spirits can be unsettling, but perhaps their requests bear further consideration?”__

Draugr__
*34931*__
Mother said that Draugr were warriors who died, but their souls were too stubborn and angry to stop fighting. They’d fight off the Valkyrie that came to collect them, and bring their own dead bodies back to life… warping and twisting their previous form into something else. Now they’re husks of their former selves, and fight anybody they can find. She also said they can come back in all different shapes and sizes and that some even have powers that others may not.__
*34932*__
Heavy Draugr__
*34933*__
These Draugr seem bigger than the ones we first encountered. They carry heavier, more dangerous weapons. It makes them slower, but they’re a LOT stronger than the regular ones.__
*34934*__
Draugr (Shield)__
*34935*__
I already knew that Draugr weren’t just mindless monsters, but I didn’t think they were smart enough to use a shield. They like using it, too. We’ll have to change up our strategy a bit and see where we can find an opening.__
*34936*__
Draugr (Dual Wield)__
*34937*__
A Draugr with two weapons is twice as dangerous, right? When they’re with a more defensive enemy, we should consider taking down these dual-wielding Draugr early in the fight and not turn our back on them.__
*34938*__
Draugr (Projectile)__
*34939*__
These Draugr can shoot fireballs. How do they do that? They like to attack from a distance, which can be really annoying when we’re fighting a bunch of other enemies, but luckily they go down pretty quickly.__
*34940*__
Draugr (Speed)__
*34941*__
What’s more terrifying than a Draugr? A Draugr that can run at you really fast. Mother said some Draugr had special powers, and these ones are able to shoot fire out of their legs and move quickly around the battlefield. We’ll need to be on our toes.__
*34942*__
Draugr (Explosive)__
*34943*__
I’m not sure how they do it, but these Draugr store energy in their bodies, and then explode on contact. But the explosion doesn’t hurt them at all! I wonder if it feels good to them? Anyways, we should attack from a distance when we see that they are fully charged up.__
*34944*__
Draugr (Power Weapon)__
*34945*__
As if the undead trying to kill us with sharp objects wasn’t bad enough, some Draugr can channel energy through their arms, charging their weapons and making them even more dangerous. Getting hit with a rusty old sword hurts, but getting hit with a fire-charged sword hurts worse.__
*34946*__
It takes a beat for him to recover after swinging, if we dodge, he’ll be open to a counter-attack.__
*34947*__
His attacks are so strong, it makes blocking them really hard. Father should probably just dodge them.__
*34948*__
Swinging wildly won’t break his guard, but if Father uses his Block Break, he should be able to find an opening (Double Tap [BlockButton]).__
*34949*__
Parrying his attacks can also break his guard.__
*34950*__
These Draugr really know how to use their weapons. We need to be ready for several attacks at once.__
*34951*__
With two weapons they like to combo their attacks, but we can disrupt their flow by parrying their attacks.__
*34952*__
They can attack from long range, but we should be safe if we dodge or block.__
*34953*__
These speedy enemies can be hard to hit. Father should wait for them to rush him and parry their attacks.__
*34954*__
I see them stomp their feet right before they charge. Should help us spot their incoming attacks.__
*34955*__
We should avoid hitting them with melee attacks when they’re powered up, we’ll be knocked back by an explosion.__
*34956*__
Father should throw his axe at them when they’re powered up. They’ll explode and damage all nearby enemies.__
*34957*__
They power up their weapon and attack with a forward moving shockwave.__
*34958*__
They have a strong attack, but if we dodge to the side we should be okay.__
*34959*__
Revenant (Poison)__
*34960*__
Mother once told me that some witches trade little bits of their soul here and there to become more powerful in Seiðr magic. Eventually, they lose every part of their humanity and become Revenants. They can disappear in an instant, and these particular Revenants are able to spread poison through touch and breath.__
*34961*__
Revenant (Summoner)__
*34962*__
This kind of Revenant can actually summon Nightmares. Does she create them with her Seiðr magic, or are they all just squeezed together in her pack? I wonder how so many of them fit in that little pack.__

Tatzelwurm__
*34968*__
A Tatzelwurm is part lizard, part cat—a Lizard-Cat! Or a Cat-Lizard… or something. Either way, the combination is pretty weird. They like to burrow underground to close the distance between them and their prey. Their claws and teeth are extremely sharp, but it’s that poisonous barb on their tails that we really need to watch out for.__
*34969*__
Cursed Tatzelwurm__
*34970*__
This Tatzelwurm doesn’t have the poisonous barb, but it does have a sac in its throat that lets it barf poison at us. I know; it’s really gross. The poison is deadly to the touch, so even if we dodge the attack, we still need to be careful not to step in it.__

*34978*__
Dark Elf Summoner__
*34979*__
Dark Elf Lord__
*34980*__
I’ve always admired wolves, but the ones we’ve encountered attack us on sight, which means they’re probably rabid. I guess to them, we are food. I know it’s kill or be killed, but still… they’re beautiful in their own way, and killing them makes me a little sad. Good thing Father probably won’t read this.__
*34981*__
We’ve seen a lot of aggressive wolves, but these are something else… some other kind of disease. They spit out some kind of poison that we should avoid walking in, and they’re even more aggressive than the rabid ones. I bet we would be doing them a favor by putting them out of their misery.__
*34982*__
These things are a complete mystery. They always show up in groups, but at least they go down fairly easily. They don’t have weapons, but they can grow their limbs into sharp points that are just as dangerous. They also tend to try and latch onto Father, and use their greater numbers to overwhelm us.__
*34983*__
These faceless creatures are very aggressive and don’t hesitate to run straight at us. They clearly have the same kind of ice powers we see from anything that comes from Hel. They fall very easily to Father’s Blades.__
*34984*__
Unlike the Light Elves of Alfheim, the Dark Elves prefer dark places. Maybe that’s why they want to cover up the Light? They can fly and seem pretty smart and well-coordinated; more so than most of the enemies we’ve fought so far. Their weapons are useful; effective up close and at a distance. Kind of like Father’s axe!__
*34985*__
This type seems stronger than the average Dark Elf. They swing their heavy weapons so hard it creates a shock wave, making their attacks really tough to dodge.__
*34986*__
This one is able to call in reinforcements, so we should take him down quickly. They should be easy to spot, thanks to the bright glow in their wings. I wonder how many Dark Elves there are in Alfheim?__
*34987*__
Bigger, faster, and stronger than any Dark Elf we’ve fought so far. Their attacks are so strong they can blind and deafen us for a bit. They fight a lot like regular Dark Elves, just WAY harder.__
*34988*__

*34989*__
The Dwarves can take fragments of the World Serpent’s old scales and form a fresh scale.__
*34990*__

*34991*__
The Dwarves can break apart a scale of the World Serpent to form smaller fragments.__
*34992*__
Dauði Kaupmaðr__
*34993*__
I think the troll we just fought was Dauði Kaupmaðr. Mother used to always tell me stories about him to try and scare me if I wandered off too far. I think she’d be proud of me, but Father thinks because I got a little angry that I’m “not ready.” Whatever. I just helped him kill a troll; I know I’m ready!__
Mother told me a lot of stories about trolls. This one’s name translates to Death Merchant. With a name like that, I think it’s safe to assume he was pretty evil. I’m glad we killed him.__
*34994*__
Nightmare__
*34995*__
Mom used to tell me stories about Nightmares until, well… I started having nightmares. I was embarrassed, but she said they were just another part of life, and that sometimes there was “beauty in the horror.” She always saw the upside to everything, even these creepy little floating eye monsters. They’re named after an older creature, called a Mare, that sits on your chest while you sleep and feeds off your fear.__
*34996*__
Nightmare Parasite__
*34997*__
As if Nightmares weren’t annoying enough, it looks like this type can actually possess other creatures and make them stronger. Does the possessed creature have any control over their actions, or are they just trapped in some horrific waking nightmare? Not a very nice thought.__
*34998*__
Ogre__
*34999*__
Giant, powerful, angry, but thankfully not very smart. The Ogre is one of the ugliest enemies we’ve fought. Their huge arms give their attacks good range, and they can hit the ground so hard it creates powerful shock waves.__
*35000*__
Fierce Ogre__
*35001*__
These Ogres are similar in size to the regular ones, but they can cover long distances with a single jump. And… they smell REALLY bad. I wonder if that’s why they’re so angry all the time?__
*35002*__
Ice Nightmare__
*35003*__
These Nightmares can use the same power of frost that we’ve seen the Hel-Walkers use. These attacks will slow us down if they manage to hit.__
*35004*__
Hel-Revenant__
*35005*__
Like the other Hel-Walkers, the Hel-Revenant attacks with ice that can slow us down. Mother used to tell me bedtime stories about the Revenants, but she never mentioned this kind. Maybe she thought it was too scary for me.__

*35098*__
We found the son of the Reaver Spirit we met back at Fáfnir’s storeroom. Looks like the son’s mutiny led to another mutiny in the end. I guess he had it coming… but it’s still a little sad. Back to the boat now, to bring Sindri his whetstone.__
*35099*__
The water wheel that we freed earlier is blocking the way we came in. We’ll have to find a back door. I noticed a grate near the ship, I bet we can open it and get out that way.__

Stonebeard King__
*35109*__
Mother said Stonebeard King earned his title “King” simply because no one could take it from him. If you are arrogant enough to call yourself a king, you better be able to back it up, and Stonebeard could.  He never lost a fight… until now.__
*35110*__
Grendel of the Frost__
*35111*__
Grendel of the Frost was the stuff of legend. Even Mother thought he was just a myth. It was said that Grendel was the strongest and most feared among the Stone Troll Tribe. They hold the name “The Frost” in the highest regard, and only give it to someone who is to be honored and revered. And now he’s dead. Serves him right for trying to kill us!__
*35113*__
Death Eater__
*35115*__
Mother never mentioned this troll. Guess he never did anything special to earn an interesting bedtime story. And now he never will.__
*35116*__
Máttugr Helson__
*35117*__
Máttugr Helson, known as Helheim’s son and bridge keeper. Apparently, he was actually born and raised in Hel. Growing up in a troll tribe can’t be an easy life, but growing up in Hel must be even worse.__
*35118*__
Lake of Light__
*35219*__
Valkyries__
*35220*__
Dragons__
*35221*__
Fire Nightmare__
*35222*__
These Nightmares shoot fireballs. As if we needed MORE reasons to hate Nightmares.__
*35223*__
Exploding Nightmare__
*35224*__
These Nightmares like to swarm in close and then explode. Why do they sacrifice themselves like this? Maybe they are all part of some kind of hive mind. Whatever the reason, it’s really annoying.__
*35225*__
Wolves typically hunt in packs and will try to surround their prey. Father should try to keep them in front of him and let me help draw their attention.__
*35226*__
When these wolves howl, we should be ready for a strong attack.__
*35227*__
We’ll have to be extra careful not to step in the stuff they vomit up. It’s poisonous. Smells real bad, too.__
*35228*__
The poison from these wolves makes attacking up close risky. My bow and Father’s axe throw is a safer way to take them down.__
*35229*__
Using the [HeavyAttackButton] axe throw will freeze them and bring them down to earth.__
*35230*__
My arrows can stun them which will allow Father to finish them off. If he grabs them when stunned, he can throw them at other enemies and they’ll explode!__
*35231*__
As soon as they start charging us, just one hit to their body will blow them up. The explosion hurts other enemies, too! Could be useful when fighting a big group.__
*35232*__
If they get too close to us, they’ll explode. We need to hit them at range.__
*35234*__
Brenna Dauði__
*35235*__
Dauði Munr__
*35236*__
Grendel of the Ashes__
*35237*__
Seiðr Reavers are able to heal, so if we start attacking one, we should try to finish the job quickly.__
*35238*__
When they die, they detonate in a poison cloud. If we’re too close, we should try to dodge away.__
*35241*__
They only attack after they’ve conjured an explosive Seiðr magic spell. We should rush them down before they can throw it, or try and dodge.__
*35242*__
If they do create their bomb, Father can disrupt them by throwing his axe before they have time to throw it.__
*35243*__
We should kill these guys quickly, they’re able to heal from most wounds.__
*35244*__
We should watch out when they power up their weapon with Seiðr magic. They can do a powerful triple slam attack.__
*35245*__
He is slow but very sturdy. We should dodge his horizontal swings backwards and his vertical swings sideways and attack him in the time it takes to recover.__
*35246*__
The Traveler has a magical rune. If we see him lift it in his hand, Father should throw his axe at it.__
*35247*__
These Travelers must be a paranoid bunch, because they keep a huge shield on their back that will deflect any attempt to back stab him.__
*35248*__
We’ll have to watch for him to turn and attack before striking him from the front.__
*35249*__
These Nightmares come after me and try to take me out of the fight, but Father can stop them. Hopefully he will…__
*35250*__
We can either dodge their shots, or interrupt them with an arrow or axe throw. The stronger ones can shoot faster.__
*35251*__
These Nightmares try their hardest to possess other enemies, making those enemies a lot stronger.__
*35252*__
If we stun or kill a possessed enemy, it will force the possessing Nightmare out of their body.__
*35253*__
They can poison us, and we need to be extra careful of their leaping attack.__
*35254*__
The Brood explode when they die. We can use this to damage and knock away any nearby enemies.__
*35255*__
Her pestilence powder leaves poison hazards in the environment. If Father steps in them, he’ll be damaged and poisoned.__
*35256*__
Her fissure attack can move around obstacles to hit us. Father has a better chance of dodging if he waits until it’s closer.__
*35257*__
She tries to summon Nightmares often, so we need to make sure we interrupt her to avoid being overrun by them.__
*35258*__
Her powder smokescreen clouds can blind us, and they provide cover for her follow-up attacks. We should avoid them as much as we possibly can.__
*35259*__
When Father throws his axe at a Tatzelwurm as it burrows towards him, it’ll pop them out of the ground.__
*35260*__
Launching and attacking Tatzelwurms as they dig into the ground will stop them from burrowing for a short time.__
*35261*__
Their spit is highly poisonous, even on the ground. Throwing the axe with [HeavyAttackButton] will freeze them and keep them from burrowing underground.__
*35262*__
Attacks that slam the ground can pop nearby Tatzelwurms out of their burrows.__
*35263*__
This Ogre has a very quick tell before he attacks. Father can use that to get out of the way.__
*35264*__
Father is strong enough to block one of his attacks, but it takes some time for him to recover. Smarter to avoid it altogether.__
*35265*__
If Father can goad an Ogre into using their jump smash, it’ll take them a couple of moments to recover if they miss. I just hope they miss.__
*35266*__
Getting behind an Ogre is a good opportunity for Father to do some damage. But if they turn and see him, they’ll definitely attack.__
*35267*__
A Wulver’s howl is a sign they are going into a frenzy, where they can attack with incredible speed.__
*35268*__
If Father finds himself caught in the Wulver’s frenzy attack, I may be able to draw the Wulver’s attention with a well placed arrow.__
*35269*__
When a Wulver crouches on all fours, they become very difficult to hit. We need to be on our guard and not leave ourselves open to counter attack.__
*35270*__
The other Wulver gets a lot faster after it starts howling. This one seems to get a lot stronger. We should be really, really careful after this one starts howling.__
*35273*__
These enemies become enraged and super aggressive when you’re frosted. Father should do his best to avoid their frost blast attack.__
*35274*__
If these things do manage to freeze us, we should stay on the defensive until it passes.__
*35275*__
Hel-Walkers with shields can block just about anything. Father can use his Block Break skill to break their guard.__
*35276*__
Father should throw his axe at their feet to get around their shields and trip them up.__
*35277*__
These enemies will deflect Father’s frost axe attacks. He’ll have to use his fists instead to stun them.__
*35278*__
Hel-Walkers seem to draw their power from the frost, which makes Father’s axe pretty weak against them. Good thing he’s strong with his fists, too. I wish we had a fire weapon.__
*35279*__
Their projectiles are quick but don’t stun us. If we rush them, we can take them out of the equation early.__
*35280*__
I should be able to help Father with these enemies. Just like their projectiles disrupt his movements, my bow can disrupt theirs.__
*35281*__
They can cast an ice wall as cover. Father can throw the axe when they pop up behind cover, or throw it past them and recall it to hit them from behind.__
*35282*__
Their ice walls do more than just provide cover: if we get too close, they can detonate it. We should try to deal with them from range.__
*35283*__
Father can dodge his mace depending on the type of swing. Looks like it’s best to dodge horizontal swings backwards, and the vertical swings sideways.__
*35284*__
If he misses his overhead attack, his mace gets stuck in the ground and he’s open for an attack.__
*35285*__
The Undead Travelers are more aggressive than the regular ones. Ranged attacks are tricky, because he sprints right at us.__
*35286*__
We can whittle down his armor if we stay close and dodge his strikes. But when he charges up his sword for an overhead strike, it’s time to move!__
*35287*__
They’ll look straight up before firing their ice projectile, so we should either get out of the way or hit them with Father’s axe (or my arrows).__
*35288*__
When Father throws his axe at Nightmares, it knocks them closer to the ground. Then he can use melee attacks to finish them off.__
*35289*__
Their air slam attacks can leave us slowed. If they’re up in the air, steer clear.__
*35290*__
The Brood are extremely weak to Father’s Runic Attacks.__
*35291*__
Her icy fissure attacks damage and freeze Father. We’ll have to avoid them if we want to be able to take her down.__
*35292*__
We can either interrupt, outrun, or dodge her ice-breath attack – it can freeze Father and leave him idle and vulnerable to attacks.__
*35296*__
Dark Elves like to attack as a group. When Father lands a heavy hit or parries, it tends to break the swarm.__
*35297*__
If we can freeze or weaken the Dark Elves, it will prevent them from using air recoveries when launched.__
*35298*__
We should watch out for their charge attacks. They can cause temporary blindness. It’s hard to fight when you can’t see anything!__
*35299*__
They are much easier to kill when grounded. Tripping them up seems to work pretty well.__
*35300*__
When he spins his weapon, it means he’s about to call in more Dark Elves. We should stop him before he slams it into the ground.__
*35301*__
He can block axe throws, but if we catch him off guard, Father’s heavy axe throw will freeze him and negate his speed.__
*35302*__
It’s so strong and has thick armor, but leaves itself open after certain attacks.__
*35303*__
If we can freeze or weaken it, it won’t be able to recover in the air when launched or knocked out of aerial attacks.__
*35304*__
Father can hit them twice on the same axe throw; once on the throw and again on the recall.__
*35305*__
These would make good target practice for me and my bow. A couple of arrows would probably bring them down.__

Reaver__
*36833*__
These were just normal human Reavers once, but they look like they’ve been corrupted by Seiðr magic. When did this start happening?__
*36834*__
Shadow__
*36835*__
These were human Reavers, but now that they’ve embraced the ways of the Seiðr, they can throw magic spells at a distance.__
*36836*__
Viken__
*36837*__
These Seiðr Reavers like to use big maces when they fight. Mom always referred to them as “Vikens,” for some reason.__
*36838*__
Traveler__
*36839*__
They wear really strong armor, have huge swords, and are one of the toughest enemies we’ve faced. Who are they, and what do they want with us? Mom never mentioned the Travelers. I hope we don’t have to fight too many of them.__
*36954*__
Traveler Champion__
*36955*__
This Traveler has a huge shield on his back, which makes breaking through his extremely tough armor even tougher.__
*36956*__
Wulver__
*36957*__
They look like wolves, but they stand upright like humans and are a lot smarter. And stronger. And faster. Their fur is so dense, it makes them tough to put down. They remind me a little of those Berserkers that Father put down last summer… but wolves instead of bears.__
*36958*__
Fierce Wulver__
*36959*__
This looks like an even tougher breed of Wulver. They’re smarter, too. Really, really dangerous creatures. Glad my bowstring has some magic in it, otherwise I’m not sure how we’d bring these stronger ones down.__
*36960*__
?????????__
*36961*__
What is this thing? It looked like a Reaver, but its voice sounds so strange… Even Father doesn’t know.__
*36962*__
Hel-Reaver Guard__
*36963*__
It’s a Hel-Reaver, but it carries a shield and it knows how to use it. Guess they aren’t completely mindless.__
*36964*__
Hel-Reaver Lord__
*36965*__
These must’ve been strong Reavers back when they were alive. Now that they’re dead they are even stronger Hel-Reavers.__
*36966*__
Hel-Shadow Archer__
*36967*__
It’s like one of the Shadows, but it uses ice magic like a thrown spear. Must be one of the Hel-Walkers.__
*36968*__
Hel-Shadow Scout__
*36969*__
It acts like a Shadow, but uses ice magic instead of Seiðr magic. Definitely a Hel-Walker.__
*36970*__
Hel-Viken__
*36971*__
It’s a Viken, but a dead one. So, a Hel-Viken? This Hel-Walker is just as strong as its Seiðr counterpart. Maybe even stronger.__
*36972*__
Hel-Traveler__
*36973*__
I didn’t think the Travelers could get much worse, but it looks like death wasn’t enough to keep this one down. In fact, it’s even MORE aggressive than the other Travelers we’ve seen. I guess even Travelers can become Hel-Walkers.__

We’re going back to the Lake of Nine to talk to the World Serpent again, since Mimir speaks his language. I wonder if I could learn it too?__

We met this Dwarf on our way to the Mountain, and he’s a blacksmith. A famous blacksmith, apparently. He made the Leviathan Axe! He upgraded it for Father, too. He was a little rude and grouchy, but I kind of like him anyway. I hope we see him again!__
*37129*__
Sindri__
*37130*__
Sindri’s also a famous blacksmith, but he and his brother are really different. Sindri REALLY doesn’t like dirt and grime. Weird trait for a blacksmith Dwarf, but he’s just as talented as his brother. I wonder why they don’t get along?__
*37131*__
Blightguard__
*37132*__
Andvari__
*37133*__
Low Perk activation chance to strike with an explosive curse that inflicts WEAKNESS to enemies on any successful hit.__
*37134*__
Andvari wasn’t very helpful at first, but something about seeing that dead Soul Eater in the Landsuther Mines made him realize he was being kind of a jerk. I think he feels guilty because he and some other Dwarves were experimenting with Ancients there, and they accidentally created Soul Eaters. Glad we didn’t have to fight any more.__
Anyway, his soul is still trapped in a ring. Brok wanted to melt him down (he can be so mean sometimes!), but I convinced Father to keep him, and now he’s part of our group. Father even uses Andvari’s soul as an Enchantment sometimes. Must be hard being trapped in a piece of jewelry, but Andvari doesn’t complain TOO much. I’ve gotten pretty good at ignoring him.__
*37135*__
Motsògnir__
*37136*__
Grips of the Valkyrie__
*37137*__
The Dwarf King. One of the Sons of Ivaldi. He ruled over humans both in Veithurgard and Konùnsgard. He was a good king at first, but then he started having dreams about his people dying. For some reason, he thought forcing them to hunt deadly beasts was the way to save them. He captured three dragons to harvest their ‘Fury’, killed innocent people to harvest their ‘Screams’, and was then killed by those very same people when they returned as Hel-Walkers. That created ‘Ultimate Sacrifice.’ We can use these three ingredients to create some kind of legendary armor.__
*37138*__
Baldur__
*37139*__
Baldur… He’s one of the Aesir. Odin’s son, Thor’s brother. He came to our house and fought Father and Father killed him. Or… so we thought. Supposedly he can’t feel pain. And now he’s hunting us with his nephews, but we don’t know why.__
*37140*__
Low Perk activation chance on any successful Blades hit to grant Power of the Valkyrie, increasing [Icons:STRENGTH] STRENGTH and [Icons:RUNIC] RUNIC. (Stacks up to 3 times max.)__
*37141*__
Witch of the Woods__
*37142*__
We met a Witch in the Woods who knows the old magic! Turns out the magic boar is her friend. She was mad that I shot him at first, but we were able to save his life. She lives under a giant turtle creature (who’s also her friend) and she seems really nice.__
*37143*__
Magni__
*37144*__
Evasive Defense__
*37145*__
The older son of Thor. He had a huge sword, could use the power of lightning, and was really mean. Father killed him.__
*37146*__
Modi__
*37147*__
Evasive Runic__
*37148*__
The younger son of Thor, and a relentless creep. He also can shoot lightning, and uses a mace and shield. He ran off after Father killed his brother, Magni, but I bet we haven’t seen the last of him. I’ll kill him next time I see him.__

Moderate Perk activation chance to grant a Blessing of [Icons:RUNIC] RUNIC on any successful last-second evade.__
*37157*__
Moderate Perk activation chance to grant a Gift of [Icons:DEFENSE] DEFENSE on any successful last-second evade.__
*37158*__
Mom once told me a story about Otr; he was a Dwarf who could turn into an otter (which is how he got his name, I guess). Is this the same Otr? How did he become a dragon? I’d ask Father, but I know he doesn’t care. It’s when I have so many questions like this… that’s when I miss Mother the most.__
*37159*__
Reginn__
*37160*__
Reginn was captured by the Dwarf King and forced to act as Sentry of Konùnsgard. He’s not very good at it; there are monsters everywhere. I guess that’s what happens when you force a dragon to stand guard against his will. The Dwarf King must’ve wanted to capture these dragons for a different purpose…__
*37161*__
Fáfnir__
*37162*__
Fáfnir was a Dwarf. One of the Sons of Ivaldi, according to Mimir. But he was very greedy, and his greed turned him into a dragon. It sounds ridiculous, but I saw him with my own eyes… he was a dragon! I wonder if it was painful to turn from Dwarf to dragon? How long did it take? I had a bunch of questions for him, but he flew off before I could ask any.__
*37163*__
Gullveig__
*37164*__
A spirit convinced me that Gullveig, a powerful witch that was killed a long time ago, could “reunite” us with Mother. Father didn’t believe him. I shouldn’t have either… but for a chance to see Mom again, it seemed like we should give it a try, right?__
Once we collected all her bones, Gullveig was resurrected, and said she’d reunite us, “In death!” And then attacked us. We killed her, obviously. I was really upset with myself. How could I fall for such an obvious lie? But Father said to “take it as a lesson,” so that’s what I’m gonna do. No more trusting spirits.__

Mimir said of Gunnr: “Mistress of War. After any conflict, big or small, she would be first on the scene, sussing out the worthy spirits for a free trip to Valhalla. A gruesome task, but she took great pride in it. Her judgement of the fallen was unparalleled, and an invaluable resource to Odin. She was one of his favorites.”__
*37169*__
Geirdriful__
*37170*__
Mimir said of Geirdriful: “Master of Arms in Valhalla. Responsible for arming and training Odin’s einherjar. His army, come Ragnarök. The einherjar wait in the great hall, endlessly feasting, drinking and fu— ahem uh… fornicating themselves silly. Once Ragnarök begins, Odin calls them into service to fight on his behalf. Geirdriful had her hands full, training that lot.”__

Mimir said of Eir: “The Healer. Strange, for a Valkyrie. Very quiet. Very calm. Where her sisters were violent rapids, Eir was a gentle stream. She healed the wounds of both mortals and gods… and even a certain all-knowing sage who once drank too much and fell off a mountain.”__
*37173*__
Prayer to Odin__
*37174*__
Beware of Seiðr__
*37175*__
“Find here our sacrifice, mighty Allfather, and deliver Midgard from Hel’s wild hunt. Odin, wisest of all, whose breath gave life to Ask and Embla, first among our people, we beg your protection. Send forth your noble Valkyries and cull the deathless. Send forth your noble sons, Thor and Baldur, to shield us. Send forth dragons to consume the frigid horde. Save our souls that we may serve you evermore.”\n\nI don’t think Odin got the message. Or he didn’t care…__
*37176*__
“Beware of Seiðr and those who practice it! Their sorcery is insidious and ever-changing, and so are the souls who master it. The more power they summon, the less they are themselves.”\n\nIs that how they turn into Revenants?__
*37177*__
The Light of Alfheim__
*37178*__
“From the light we are born, and to light we return. The light is the river of souls, transforming us, consuming us, transcending life and death. The light is the truth. The light is all.”\n\nOKAY! The light sounds great but maybe it also makes you crazy?__
*37179*__
The Great Mountain__
*37180*__
“When the mountain was cold, it was Meløða and Ǫnþreis who gave it life. Wandering souls from distant lands, who had tasted of the Mead of Poetry and in search of inspiration found each other—and in each other, found great love. To the summit of Midgard’s great mountain, a secret bridge was built. Here they would make their hearth and fortress—to live free of prophecy, and know only themselves and each other. The mountain became a shelter for the outcast and the artist, for Jötnar and new friends made. And to this beacon many more souls made pilgrimage. Even now, as we shelter from the storm, let none forget the beckoning spirit of the mountain that was.”\n\nSounds like the mountain used to be pretty amazing… Mom always did love artists.__
*37181*__
Rites of Fjörgyn__
*37182*__
“Here we bear witness to the funeral rites of Fjörgyn of the Jötnar, goddess of the earth and trees. For her beauty she was seduced, for her love she was betrayed, and for her gift of life, her life was claimed. To the summit and across the bridge she shall be borne, where nevermore the Thunder may find her.”\n\nDid Thor kill his own mother?! Was that the first Giant he killed? What does it mean??__
*37183*__
The Long, Cruel War__
*37184*__
“Here fell Nerthus of the Vanir, slain by Magni and Modi, sons of Thor. The Jötnar bear witness to the cruelty of this Long War. Neither Aesir nor Vanir may triumph, it is foreseen -- but what may be left of Midgard before they lay down arms?”\n\nThe Giants wanted peace… no wonder they liked Týr so much…__
*37185*__
Prayer to Frigg__
*37186*__
“Hail Frigg! Generous Frigg, who gave the world her brightest light — young Baldur, gleaming god, pride of the Aesir, Odin-Son and heir to Asgard. Long may she protect him. Long may he protect us. Hail Baldur the Golden. Hail Frigg, beloved of all! Hail Odin Allfather!”\n\nSeems like nobody who counted on the Aesir is still around…__
*37187*__
Motsògnir’s Throne__
*37188*__
“After many winters, the Stronghold of Konùnsgard is complete! Mótsognir has invited all citizens to attend the grand ceremony in the throne room. There we await the calming words of our King, who promises everlasting safety and prosperity.__
This new land is even more fertile than Veithurgard. And with Reginn as our stalwart sentry, we fear naught from the Reavers, Dark Elves, nor any malevolent force! The reign of King Mótsognir is truly blessed by Týr himself! All Hail the Dwarf King, Protector of Man!”__
Huh, sounds like they actually liked this Dwarf King. The people in Veithurgard sure didn’t… I wonder what changed?__
*37189*__
Reginn of Konùnsgard__
*37190*__
“Much like Otr of Veithurgard, Reginn has been conscripted as Head Sentry of Konùnsgard. Though he may occasionally struggle against his bindings, he takes great pride in his task. His thunderous breath, while extraordinarily dangerous, is merely his way of expressing pride. However, do take caution during weekly maintenance of the Dragon Shrines; Reginn will attempt to use his breath on you. This is not meant as an attack; it is merely his own cheeky way of passing the time. But make sure you vacate the area immediately, because it will kill you.__
All rumors that Reginn’s presence attracts the Dark Elves of Alfheim is pure fiction. King Mótsognir will protect us from all beasts, as he has done time and time again.”__
Yeah… I don’t believe any of this.__
*37191*__
Ruins of Veithurgard__
*37192*__
“Nothing remains of Veithurgard except the ruins of Mótsognir’s cruelty. The once fertile soil is barren, soaked with the blood of both hunters and the hunted. It was The ‘Noble’ Dwarf King himself who demanded the bloodshed. He who conscripted the gentle farmers of these lands into an army of ill-equipped hunters; he whose thirst for savage beasts produced a legion of widows.__
The castle still stands for those foolish enough to scavenge, wherein dwells the deadliest of his quarry. Let caution guide you.”__
Yikes… Doesn’t sound like a very nice place. Father will probably want to visit anyways to look for useful resources. He’s gotten a little predictable, but I’m still having fun seeing new places with him.__
*37193*__
An Unbreakable Chain__
*37194*__
“Otr has escaped his binds yet again. Instead of flying off this time, he seeks revenge on his captors, and is determined to turn Veithurgard to ash. We seek shelter in the outlying caves where we’ve found sanctuary in the past.__
Our King assures us his next chain will be unbreakable. If anyone can build an unbreakable chain, it’s Mótsognir. Architect of the great Stronghold of Konùnsgard! Leader of a glorious new age in Veithurgard! All Hail the Dwarf King, Protector of Man!”__
These people seem a little friendlier… for all the good it did them.__
*37195*__
Cost of the Hunt__
*37196*__
“Six Wolves – Two men. Lo do they call to me.__
Thirteen Draugr – Nine men. Lo do they call to me.__
Three Tatzelwurms – Six men. Lo do they call to me.__
One Troll – One and forty men. Lo do they call to me.__
One Dragon – Nine and ninety men. Lo do they call to me.”__
Sounds like these people weren’t very good at hunting. Maybe they should’ve just stuck with deer and boar.__
*37197*__
The Gravedigger__
*37198*__
“While I throw dirt on the mangled citizens of Veithurgard, Mótsognir looks upon his newly caged beast with a gleeful fervor. I curse his name. The Dwarf King set the capture of trolls and dragons above the safety of his own followers. The same followers who served and revered him, hunted these monsters, and died, forgotten.__
My attempt to free the beast failed, and Mótsognir’s punishment was swift: I am banned from Konùnsgard. Demoted to town gravedigger. A fitting end for a once proud hunter, whose prey hastened the fall of Veithurgard.”__
—Berhtolt__
*37199*__
The Hunt for Death__
*37200*__
“We baited the beast with a stuck fawn. Her cries echoed on the morning breeze. It did not take long for Death’s Hammer to approach. The smell of burnt grass, the bleating of the dying fawn, the fear of imminent death… many could not hold their breakfast. When it stepped into the clearing, our attack was swift.__
The vanguard died instantly, burned to ash. No time to react, the hunt continued as we led the enraged troll to the Lake of Nine. There we subdued it, but not before losing thirty more men.__
Upon our return, King Mótsognir proclaimed a week of celebration. The festivities were sparsely attended, though not for lack of pride in the victory. The population of Veithurgard had just been reduced by a quarter. I fear this sad irony was lost on the Dwarf.”__
—Berhtolt__
*37201*__
The Curse of Ivaldi__
*37202*__
“Turn back! Upon this place sits the curse of Ivaldi, whose talents threatened the gods of Asgard. The mists of Niflheim were made a weapon by my father’s alchemy, and turned upon their creator. His skill as an inventor and craftsman were unrivaled… but it was his talent and genius which drew the ire of the Aesir in the first place. Therefore I, Mótsognir, renounce this place. I renounce dwarvenkind. I am off to seek refuge and self-imposed exile in Midgard. Those who do not flee this realm will join my father in the grave.”__
—Mótsognir, Son of Ivaldi__
*37212*__
Completed__
*37213*__
Ivaldi’s armor was the peak of Niflheim craftsmanship, but this set is small and has grown decrepit. Sindri may be able to make use of it.__
*37214*__
Anchor of Fog__
*37215*__
To hide his machinations from Odin, Ivaldi crafted devices that could pull anything from Niflheim back to its home. Use (with caution) to open Realm Tears in Niflheim.__

Göndul__
*37352*__
Mimir said of Göndul: “The sight of Göndul always took my breath away. Göndul had a silver tongue, a sharp wit, and struck a figure so stunning, it literally drove men insane. Odin forbid her from setting foot in Midgard after a time, as insanity is not a welcome trait in Valhalla.”__
*37353*__
Hildr__
*37354*__
Mimir said of Hildr: “Mistress of Battle. She and Odin got on quite well, actually. Her and the other Valkyries… not so much. She would spend most of her time here in Midgard, observing discord between the living, and stirring some up herself from time to time. She lived for conflict. Some say she WAS conflict, personified. I wonder what will become of her, now that she’s free.”__
*37355*__
Olrun__
*37356*__
Mimir said of Olrun: “Once the daughter of a powerful chieftain, she fell defending him during a Reaver attack. Olrun was escorted to Valhalla, where she chose to devote her after-life to the pursuit of knowledge above all else. Quite unusual behavior amongst the constant drinking and feasting of her fellow Valhallian-denizens. Odin saw a kindred spirit in Olrun’s single-minded pursuit of knowledge and appointed her as the Valkyrie’s resident historian.”__
*37357*__
Kara__
*37358*__
Mimir said of Kara: “Wild Storm personified. Calm and collected… Then the air would shift, and the fury of her storm would unleash. ’Twas beautiful, in a way, assuming you could find proper shelter. Her tears would cleanse the blood-soaked battlefields.”__
*37359*__
Ròta__
*37360*__
Mimir said of Ròta: “One of the Choosers of the Slain. Ròta was the first to go mad after being imprisoned in a physical form. Sigrun stashed her in Helheim to keep her away from harming herself or others. Mostly others.”__
*37361*__
Sigrun__
*37362*__
Mimir said of Sigrun: “Queen of the Valkyries, although she does not appear to refer to herself as such. When Freya, the original Queen Valkyrie, lost her wings to Odin, Sigrun grudgingly took the position in her stead. Now she is free to reunite the Valkyries and attempt to stem the tide of the dead flowing into Midgard.”__
*37363*__
The Soul Eaters__
*37364*__
“Removing an Ancient’s soul and domesticating it as a beast of burden was surprisingly easy. They followed my every command, and appeared to possess no free will, sense of self-preservation, or even hunger. Well… not until it turned poor Lit into ashes. Not even his soul remained.__
A lack of their own must be what drives them to immolate the souls of others. My ‘Soul Eaters’ are an abomination. Several were sent to Muspelheim at the request of Surtr; what he will use them for, I shudder to consider. Another to Mótsognir at Konùnsgard; that fool can burn for all I care.  My immediate concern is the Dwarves of the Völunder Mines.  I pray I’m not too late to undo my mistake.”__
—Andvari__
*37365*__
This is the second troll we’ve seen so far. I had no idea they were so close to our house! They’ve never bothered us before… but I guess we never bothered them either. Mother said if I ever saw a troll, I should run the other way. Guess she never said that to Father.__
*37366*__
We killed this one while trying to restore the Jötunheim Tower to the Lake of Nine in all the realms. When the doors opened to Muspelheim, I guess he wanted to see what was happening.  Why is every troll’s first and only instinct to attack?__
*37367*__
This must have been the other Grendel’s brother? Or maybe “The Ashes” is a different kind of title that the Fire Trolls use to honor their kind. There’s so much we don’t know about trolls… but I guess the most important thing to know is that they are all trying to kill us, so we have to kill them first. That’s what Father would say, anyways.__

A Son’s Regret__
*37459*__
“Dad,__
While you were off hunting and pillaging, Granddad raised me. Taught and cared for me. I loved him—and you stabbed him in the back. I hated you. But time has a way of changing things.__
The clan celebrated. They spat on his kind spirit; saw it as proof of weak leadership. And as much as I hate to admit it, the Hræzla Farmaðr thrived with you at the helm.__
As a boy, I made an oath to the Nornir that I would avenge him. My skill with a blade grew, and you finally began to notice me. We grew closer. But the Nornir do not suffer broken oaths. Not even those made by a grieving child.__
Their chest outside Fáfnir’s Storeroom… it reminded me of that oath. So the cycle of betrayal continues. You killed the only father I ever knew, but even now… I regret my actions, and am filled with remorse. Forgive me.”__

The Hræzla Farmaðr__
*37751*__
“To know the Hræzla Farmaðr is to know the brutal history of these lands. Before the Great Flood, before the Desolation, men lived peacefully in Midgard. The dead stayed dead, Draugr were a rarity, and the use of Seiðr magic was considered deeply shameful. The Hræzla Farmaðr is of the Old Ways; when a man’s worth is measured by how well he swings a blade. Strength—our highest virtue. These are harsh lands, and they are no place for the weak. The strong will prosper in life, and in death, join the ranks of the einherjar in Valhalla. The weak will scrape and suffer a meager existence, joining the ranks of unworthy in the depths of Helheim. Such is the cycle of life, ’til Ragnarök comes.”__
Harsh. They sound about as friendly as a pack of Wulvers.__

Hel-Reaver__
*37808*__
First, it was a human Reaver. Then we killed it. It died in battle, so shouldn’t the Valkyries have taken it to Valhalla? But they didn’t… it just came back as something else.__
Before she died, I overheard Mother telling Father that, “The Hel-Walkers were returning.” Is this what she was talking about? People rising from the dead? Father doesn’t seem to know (or care) much about it. Since this thing used to be a Reaver, I’ll call them, “Hel-Reavers.”__

“I hear many rumors during my travels. And while rumors have no place along the Path, their consistency gives them credence. I hear of three dragons, imprisoned in Midgard. One in Veithurgard, one in Konùnsgard, and one in a hidden ravine alongside the Lake of Nine. Should the rumors be true, these dragons are surely worth investigating.”__

Soul Eater__
*37867*__
They look almost exactly like Ancients, but there’s something… off about them. Mom always called the Soul Eaters, “Dangerous abominations.” She never said a bad word about ANY living creature (even poisonous bugs!), so her saying that always stuck with me. I wish I could tell her Father and I killed one.__
*37868*__
Dark Soul Eater__
*37869*__
An Ancient whose soul has been removed by dark Dwarven magic. It’s stronger than a regular Soul Eater, and even THOSE still terrify me.__
*37870*__
Frost Ancient__
*37871*__
We ran into a Frost Ancient on our way up the Mountain. Before this journey, I thought all the Ancients were made of fire and rock, but I guess it’s just the rock part they all share. This one must have originally been part of the Mountain itself. I bet it got tired of being a mountain, and one day just got up and walked away.__
*37872*__
Ice Ancient__
*37873*__
An Ancient in the ice and snow… I wonder if they have thoughts like we do? I can’t hear any. They don’t have mouths or ears… none that I can see, anyways. They’re mostly pretty peaceful, unless we attack first. I’d never say this to Father, but I wish we could just leave them alone.__
*37874*__
Stone Ancient__
*37875*__
One of the Ancients… I can’t believe it! Did Mom know they were still alive? They’re, well… ancient! Supposedly they’re a part of Ymir himself, and they’ve been around since the beginning of time. I thought they were all in Midgard… I wonder why this one is in Alfheim?__
*37876*__
Forest Ancient__
*37877*__
We ran into an Ancient of the Forest on our way out of Fáfnir’s Storeroom. This one was walking around, instead of just hibernating like most of them do. Or maybe we woke it up while we were trying to get inside? These Ancients are kind of beautiful… I wish their hearts weren’t so valuable.__
*37878*__
Fire Ancient__
*37879*__
I could feel the heat off this one from the boat. I guess now we know what happened to all these broken ships…__
*37880*__
Lava Ancient__
*37881*__
This Ancient has been underwater for a long time… How does it keep its fire? And why didn’t it seek higher ground?  Maybe it goes into a kind of hibernation when it’s underwater?__

Mother said this troll lived in the Heart of the Mountain with the Giants, but there was a falling out one day and they cast him out. Makes sense to me; I wouldn’t want to live with a troll. Guess he moved back in when they left.__

A King’s Last Words__
*37973*__
“Tragic that my failure becomes apparent as the life flows out of me. The gods came to me as I slept, and demanded retribution for my father’s actions in Niflheim. My people… they who entrusted me to keep them safe… every damned night, visions of them mangled by all manner of beast. Only I could protect them—and only through building the Dvegræðikr.  I captured every deadly beast I could find, and set to building myth.__
The dreams were very clear about the first two ingredients: Dragons’ Fury and Screams of the Innocent. Though many were sacrificed capturing the dragons, and the innocents’ screams were far worse than I ever imagined, all of it was for the greater good.__
Of the third ingredient, my dreams were vague. Ultimate Sacrifice is all they would say. I hoped that forfeiting my morality during this damned search would be enough. Now I see it was my own sacrifice that was required.__
Like my father before me, I’ve been such a fool.”__

“I used to live for the hunt. The excitement of stalking prey gave me a new purpose in life, one far more rewarding than the simple joy of watching crops grow. Each hunt gave me newfound confidence, and as my skill grew, so too did my arrogance.__
I downed a particularly savage Tatzelwurm on this last hunt. The beast nearly gored me several times, and my blood was hot after so many close calls. I stood over its lifeless body, too occupied with my triumph to notice its mate behind me—a mistake that cost me dearly.__
As the poison works its way to my heart, I reflect on the path my life took after the Dwarf King landed in Veithurgard, and formed his army of hunters. He gave me new purpose in life, true… but I would trade it all to spend one more day with my family as a simple farmer.”__

Land of Kings__

“Despite Otr’s presence, monsters continue to flood into Veithurgard. They poison our crops, maim our farmers, and make an already miserable existence all the more unbearable. But just as our situation reaches a breaking point, Mótsognir brings word of a safe haven; a new land he has dubbed Konùnsgard. ‘A land of riches, free from strife and danger.’ There he has promised to build us a great stronghold to shelter and protect us—though I cannot bring myself to fully trust his words. It was his irrational thirst for such monsters that brought them here to begin with! Nevertheless, it has been so long since we’ve known safety. Veithurgard was once a beautiful land. I pray to Sif that this new land of Konùnsgard is able to weather The Dwarf King’s greed.”__

“To my dearest Thorrin,__
When I was your age, I used to dream of being a god, just like our beloved Thor. It’s the reason we’re a family of stone masons; your mother and I wanted to spend our days swinging a hammer! You’ll learn, however, that dreams fade as you grow older. We’ll never join the Aesir in the halls of Asgard, but we can still use our skill to honor them.__
Your mother and I have grand plans here in Veithurgard to build a statue of Odin’s favorite son. It will be our life’s greatest work, second only to bringing you into this world.__
I’ve just completed a powerful pommel for my hammer and named it after one of Thor’s legendary goats, as it calls on the power of thunder itself. One day, when I am gone, it will keep you safe. When you hold it in your hands, let it be a reminder of all the joy that Thor has brought to our family.”__

The Dream of Midgard__
*38188*__
“Midgard was a dream of what could be if we shared, and collaborated. Jötnar, Aesir, Vanir, Elf, Dwarf, and mortals most of all. It was beautiful. But not everyone is capable of sharing. Some believe anything uncontrolled is savage, and threatening. And so we were mocked, and tricked, and used, and then slaughtered.\n\nOdin and his tribe were barred from our realm, but it was not enough. The wrath of Thor and his terrible hammer have thinned our number in Midgard to the brink of ruin. There is no option but to withdraw, while yet any live to do so.”\n\nOdin and Thor would have killed ALL the Giants if they could… and they got away with everything!__
*38189*__
The Guardian Returns__
*38190*__
“We foresee Midgard’s fate - overrun, a second Hel. Neither Odin nor his dead may reach Jötunheim. The ways must be shut. The serpent and the guardian remained. They alone shall keep our hope. When doom befalls the indestructible, only then shall the guardian return.\n\nUntil then, we await a better world - one without fear, without greed, without war. We wait for deliverance, and justice. We wait for a champion. We will wait for word that gods grow good.”\n\nHope that world gets here soon…__

Mimir is helping us figure out why Baldur of the Aesir came to our door. “I know what you are… you know what I want”—who does he think we are?__
*38196*__
Mimir on Baldur__
*38197*__
On Magni and Modi__
*38198*__
Magni and Modi, the sons of Thor, are helping their uncle Baldur find us. Strong, dangerous, foolish. Mimir has a story about them and Hrungnir—ask later.__
*38199*__
Baldur and Odin__
*38200*__
Mimir thinks Baldur is tracking us for Odin, who wants to go “where he cannot reach”… but WE can?__
*38201*__
Odin and Jötunheim__
*38202*__
If Odin and Baldur are trying to get to Jötunheim, and they think WE are the answer, how did they know that before we even knew we had to go there? Mimir insists this makes sense.__
*38203*__
Odin’s Prophecies__
*38204*__
Odin collects prophecies…tries to control fate by knowing the future. Maybe he thinks we’ll pose a threat someday. Or at least he knows we’re looking for a way to Jötunheim…__
*38205*__
Serpent’s History__
*38206*__
Jörmungandr the World Serpent has already fought Thor in Ragnarök, and was knocked back in time to now. That, or Mimir is insane.__
*38207*__
Odin’s interests in Jötunheim—he fears the Giants at Ragnarök, and wants their prophecies of the future. (Giants are the best at prophecy?) Ask Mimir later why they call Odin “Lord of the Hanged”…__
*38208*__
Odin and the Jötnar__
*38209*__
Flight of the Jötnar__
*38210*__
The Giants left Midgard to escape Thor’s slaughter—most likely their work destroying the bridges to travel there. What did they do to make the Jötunheim tower in the lake disappear?__
*38211*__
Odin spent nine days dead, hanging from Yggdrasil, the World Tree, for the wisdom of life and death and destiny. He goes REALLY far to get what he wants..!__
*38212*__
The Hanged God__
*38213*__
Nothing Is Written__
*38214*__
Odin thinks he can beat fate and change Ragnarök, even though the Serpent’s already been through it. Father doesn’t think much of fate either—“another lie told by the gods”—so they have that in common…__
*38215*__
Father kept those blades hidden under the house. If his old life is such a burden, why’d he keep them around?__
*38216*__
Father’s Blades__
*38217*__
Sigil of the Weapon__
*38218*__
Frigg and Freya__
*38219*__
“Frigg” was Freya all along?? Baldur’s mother, Odin’s wife… it’s so hard to imagine her with the Aesir gods… but I’ve seen it with my own eyes now!__
*38220*__
When the Giants trusted someone enough to help them travel the realms, they’d put Bifröst crystals in their eyes. Týr had them, and so does Mimir.__

Mimir’s Sight__
*38223*__
Mimir on the Dead__
*38224*__
Even Mimir doesn’t know why there’s so many dead men walking around Midgard… but he suspects Odin’s meddling, and maybe the Valkyries.__
*38225*__
Brok and Sindri made Thor’s Hammer, Mjölnir. It made their reputation… but it also seems like they can’t live it down.__
*38226*__
Mjölnir the Hammer__
*38227*__
The Huldra Brothers__
*38228*__
Brok and Sindri are dwarves, but for some reason people call them the “Huldra Brothers” after the beautiful forest sprites. Apparently I’m too young to be told why.__
*38229*__
So Mom was “Laufey the Just”—she really was protecting people, before she had me. They even knew of her in Asgard! I’m so proud of her…__
*38230*__
Laufey The Just__
*38231*__
Freya’s Spirit__

You’re still here? I told you to LEAVE. These are MY treasures, and you can’t have them. The best stuff is in my storeroom, anyways. But don’t even THINK about going there. That place is well-guarded, I made sure of that.__
Just leave me be. I don’t need you; I don’t need anybody. Certainly not any of Ivaldi’s stupid sons warning me about the dangers of greed. I only need look in my newly-acquired Vanir Mirror to see what it does to my skin. But I don’t care. My treasure makes me feel safe, and it warms me from the inside, like the breath of a dragon.__
Get lost.”__

FROSTED enemies move slowly and are extremely vulnerable to attack.__
*39559*__
[[D::383::::::Combat]]__
BURNED enemies take damage over time. The flames will sometimes interrupt an enemy’s attack.__
*39560*__
[[D::295::::::Combat]]__
SHOCKED enemies are locked in place and unable to attack.__
*39561*__
[[D::243::::::Combat]]__
WEAKENED enemies have weaker attacks, take more damage, and stagger more easily.__
*39562*__
[[D::183::::::Combat]]__
Frozen enemies can be shattered by repeated attacks. They can also be kicked into walls or off ledges.__
*39563*__
[[D:Crawler00:185::::::Combat]]__
Launching and juggling Tatzelwurms will prevent them from burrowing under the ground.__
*39564*__
[[D:Crawler00:185::::::Combat]]__
Attacks that slam the ground can pop nearby Tatzelwurms out of their burrows.__
*39565*__
[[D:Crawler00:295::::::Combat]]__
Atreus can use Shock Arrows to lock down Tatzelwurms and stop them from burrowing.__
*39566*__
[[D:Clone00,Clone10:340::::::Combat]]__
Brood are extremely weak to Runic Attacks.__
*39567*__
[[D:Clone00,Clone10:340::::::Combat]]__
Certain Heavy Attacks will cause Brood to fly away and explode, even at full Health.__
*39568*__
[[D:Clone00,Clone10:383::::::Combat]]__
Brood explode upon death. Use this to damage and knock away any nearby enemies.__
*39569*__
[[D:Wolf00:100::::::Combat]]__
Wolves are most dangerous in packs. Keep an eye on their positioning to avoid getting surrounded.__
*39570*__
[[D:Wolf00:100::::::Combat]]__
When a wolf howls, watch out for a strong attack.__
*39571*__
[[D:DarkOne00:210::::::Combat]]__
Watch out for Dark Elves attacking as a group. A successful attack or parry will break the swarm.__
*39572*__
[[D:DarkOne00:210::::::Combat]]__
Applying status effects such as FROST against Dark Elves will help you when fighting them.__
*39573*__
[[D:DarkOne00:210::::::Combat]]__
The Dark Elves’ light bombs will explode after a short time, evade away to avoid taking damage.__
*39574*__
[[D:Flyer00,Flyer10:180::::::Combat]]__
Use Kratos and Atreus’s ranged attacks to damage and knock Nightmares into melee range.__
*39575*__
[[D:Flyer00,Flyer10:180::::::Combat]]__
Nightmares can grab and incapacitate Atreus if they aren’t stopped.__
*39576*__
[[D:Flyer00,Flyer10:180::::::Combat]]__
Nightmares are dangerous in numbers, but die easily. Consider defeating them first to make encounters easier to finish.__
*39577*__
[[D:Flyer00,Flyer10:383::::::Combat]]__
Using the Spear of Chaos attack against Nightmares is very effective!__
*39578*__
Lava and Magma Nightmares are explosive and dangerous. Ranged attacks allow you to safely detonate them from a distance.__
*39579*__
Cursed and Corrupted Nightmares possess other enemies, buffing them. STUN or kill possessed enemies to remove the Nightmare.__
*39580*__
[[D:Flyer00,Flyer10:295::::::Combat]]__
Use Atreus’s arrows to effectively STUN Nightmares. Most Nightmares can be thrown at other enemies, dealing area damage.__
*39581*__
[[D:Golem00,Golem10,Golem20,Golem30:180::::::Combat]]__
Hits to an Ancient’s body are deflected and cause no damage.__
*39582*__
[[D:Golem00,Golem10,Golem20,Golem30:180::::::Combat]]__
Ancients must reveal their hearts in order to attack their enemies. The heart is vulnerable to ranged attacks.__
*39583*__
[[D:Golem00,Golem10,Golem20,Golem30:180::::::Combat]]__
Well-aimed axe throws to an Ancient’s exposed heart will knock off volatile chunks that eventually explode. Pick these up and throw them back using [AimButton] + [HeavyAttackButton]__
*39584*__
[[D:Golem00,Golem10,Golem20,Golem30:180::::::Combat]]__
Overloading and STUNNING an Ancient will bring it to the ground in a brief staggered state. Take advantage of this by grabbing the Ancient and hitting its heart!__
*39585*__
[[D:Golem00,Golem10,Golem20,Golem30:180::::::Combat]]__
Ancients have melee attacks that cannot be blocked or parried.__
*39587*__
[[D:Jotunn00,Jotunn10:187::::::Combat]]__
Ogres are strong and fast; beware their shockwave smash attacks, which can be avoided with a well-timed dodge.__
*39588*__
[[D:Jotunn00,Jotunn10:187::::::Combat]]__
Ogres attack indiscriminately; use this to your advantage. Their attacks often hit smaller enemies, creating opportunities before they recover.__
*39589*__
[[D:Jotunn00,Jotunn10:187::::::Combat]]__
A well-aimed axe throw at an Ogre’s head before or after it attacks is sometimes all it takes to break the Ogre’s momentum and focus.__
*39590*__
[[D:Jotunn00,Jotunn10:187::::::Combat]]__
After shockwave attacks, Ogres are momentarily stationary and easy to attack while they recover.__
*39591*__
[[D:Jotunn00,Jotunn10:187::::::Combat]]__
Beware of the Ogre’s grab!__
*39592*__
[[D:Jotunn00,Jotunn10:187::::::Combat]]__
Ogre boulder attacks cannot be blocked and should be dodged.__
*39593*__
[[D:Witch20,Witch10,Witch00:115::::::Combat]]__
When surrounded by their protective magic, Revenants evade most attacks. Atreus’s arrows can remove this magic, leaving them temporarily vulnerable to all attacks.__
*39594*__
[[D:Witch20,Witch10,Witch00:115::::::Combat]]__
Steer clear of hazards that Revenants create; they can damage Kratos and apply status effects.__
*39595*__
[[D:Witch20,Witch10,Witch00:115::::::Combat]]__
Revenants are most dangerous when encountered with other enemies. Defeating them first can make the encounter easier to handle.__
*39596*__
[[D:Witch20,Witch10,Witch00:115::::::Combat]]__
Block or dodge to the side to avoid Revenants’ raking fissure attacks. The fissures will navigate obstacles and try to find you.__
*39597*__
[[D:Witch20,Witch10,Witch00:383::::::Combat]]__
Avoid the Hel-Revenant’s ice breath attack by all means. This attack can freeze you, leaving you vulnerable to enemies.__
*39598*__
[[D:Wulver00:180::::::Combat]]__
When a Wulver howls, they enter a frenzy and their attacks become more focused and dangerous. Try a more defensive approach, and wait for openings to attack.__
*39599*__
[[D:Wulver00:180::::::Combat]]__
Wulver are aggressive and relentless. If they aren’t yet frenzied, try fighting back with an aggressive, relentless approach… it can be more effective than a defensive approach.__
*39600*__
[[D:Wulver00:180::::::Combat]]__
Some Wulver attacks can be avoided, leaving them vulnerable. Try luring them into walls to STUN them.__
*39601*__
[[D:Wulver00:180::::::Combat]]__
Parrying a Wulver’s melee swipes is an effective strategy and can be used to break their attack momentum.__
*39602*__
[[D:Wulver00:180::::::Combat]]__
Beware frenzied Wulver that are stationary and down on all fours. They can lunge and grab Kratos, mauling him. Dodge this attack!__
*39603*__
[[D:Draugr00:267::::::Combat]]__
Dual Wielding Draugr will attack quickly. Parry to break their combo.__
*39604*__
[[D:Draugr00:267::::::Combat]]__
Draugr with leg energy are hard to hit. Wait for them to come to you and parry their attacks.__
*39605*__
[[D:Draugr00:267::::::Combat]]__
When Draugr with chest energy are powered up, avoid hitting them or you’ll be knocked back by an explosion.__
*39606*__
[[D:Bandit00:120::::::Combat]]__
Hel-Reavers become enraged and aggressive when you’re FROSTED. Avoid their FROST blast attack.__
*39607*__
[[D:Bandit00:130::::::Combat]]__
After taking fatal damage, Reavers detonate in a POISON cloud. Dodge away!__
*39608*__
[[D:Brawler00:180::::::Combat]]__
Be aware of how Vikens attack! Dodge backward on their horizontal swings, and sideways on their vertical swings.__
*39609*__
[[D:Brawler00:180::::::Combat]]__
Kill Vikens quickly or they’ll regenerate Health.__
*39610*__
[[D:Traveler00:180::::::Combat]]__
Dodge sideways when Travelers attack with overhead swings.__
*39611*__
[[D:Traveler00:180::::::Combat]]__
A Traveler’s shield is impenetrable. Attack them from the front.__
*39612*__
[[D:Traveler00:180::::::Combat]]__
When Travelers hold their trophy above their heads, attack it with ranged attacks before it detonates.__
*39613*__
[[D:Troll20:430:440:::::Combat]]__
Grendel of the Frost is weak against the Blades of Chaos.__
*39614*__
[[D:Troll20,Troll10,Troll00:65::::::Combat]]__
Trolls can power up their arms and legs for Elemental attacks. These limbs are vulnerable to ranged attacks!__
*39615*__
[[D:EarthDragon00:280:290:::::Combat]]__
Deal damage to Hræzlyr’s claws to provoke his electric attacks.__
*39616*__
[[D:EarthDragon00:280:290:::::Combat]]__
Hold [BlockButton] to block stomp waves.\nHold [JoystickL] and Press [EvadeButton] to dodge claw attacks.__
*39617*__
[[D:EarthDragon00:280:290:::::Combat]]__
Shatter Crystals explode with electric energy.\nWait until Hræzlyr is electrified to throw crystals.__
*39618*__
[[D:EarthDragon00:270:280:MOV_sg1_attDragonGrabClaw01::::Combat]]__
Deal damage to Hræzlyr’s claws to release the lift.__
*39620*__
[[D::494:498:::Helheim Sky::Combat]]__
Don’t let the fires go out on the Helheim Ship.__
*39621*__
[[D::494:498:::Helheim Sky::Combat]]__
Multiple attacks from the Blades of Chaos are required to fully re-ignite the fires.__
*39622*__
[[D::494:498:::Helheim Sky::Combat]]__
Atreus’s arrows can be used to interrupt enemies before they put out the fires.\nKeep the fires fully lit!__
*39623*__
Stranger__
*39624*__
A strange man covered in tattoos came to the house and attacked Father. It must’ve been some fight… everything’s broken! Father said I wasn’t ready earlier, but something about killing this stranger changed his mind, I guess. Who was he? What did he want with us? We’re nobodies.__
*39625*__
The Goddess Freya__
*39626*__
The Witch of the Woods was the goddess Freya the whole time! No wonder she’s so good at magic. Father got REALLY mad at her when he found out. He always tells me that gods are nothing but trouble, but Freya’s always been nice to us. Maybe not all gods are bad?__

“It is done. Asgard’s defenses are impenetrable. All means of access have been cut off, save those in Odin’s power. The plague of the dead will not touch us, nor shall we fear any Vanir aggression. Word of this must reach noble Thor, for the time approaches for his part in the Allfather’s plan.”__

Svartalfheim Sealed__
*40040*__
“The realm of the dwarves is secured. For a promise of security from the rovers of Hel, they have made Asgard custodian to their borders. Now the Vanir will have no hope of Svartalfheim’s aid, thanks to Odin’s foresight. The Elves remain sufficiently distracted. All plans proceed.”__
—The Raven Keeper__
*40041*__
Vanaheim Sealed__
*40042*__
“Our vengeance upon the Vanir gods is at hand. Their realm is isolated by Odin’s spell-craft, and infiltrated presently by the God of Thunder himself. Thor’s absence may be long-felt by our folk, but we will keep up the Allfather’s work in Midgard. Our priority remains Jötunheim.”__
—The Raven Keeper__
*40043*__
The Serpent__
*40044*__
“The Serpent cannot be spoken to, but his belligerence towards the Aesir is unmistakeable. The destruction of Týr’s temple is infeasible while he remains; however, his presence has caused the Lake of Nine to submerge it completely. Therefore, the larger aim of fettering realm travel is still achieved.”__
—The Raven Keeper__
*40045*__
The Missing Tower__
*40046*__
“The search for any trace of the Jötunheim tower remains fruitless. Not only Midgard, but in all realms in which the tower once stood, there is now only a mystic echo of what was. Had it been destroyed by might, some remnant would remain, but this magical vestige suggests magical means. It must exist somewhere. Our horde of loyal spies continues to grow. I cannot doubt someday we will find it, wherever it may be hidden.”__

Traveler Scroll 4__
*40056*__
Of course! It’s “Jötunheim”… it’s always about Jötunheim, and it always comes back to Odin pulling the strings. He has a whole army devoted to finding “The Lost Path”… and here we are trying to find it first.__

Revenge of Hrimthur__
*40066*__
The Aesir finally met their match with the Vanir, and the Long War only ended when Mimir convinced Freya to marry Odin.__
*40067*__
Did Odin love Freya? Mimir thought so, for a while… but once Odin learned her magic, his old obsession with Jötunheim led him down a dark path.__
*40068*__
When Freya finally left Odin, he cursed her, trapping her in Midgard and stealing her Warrior Spirit. Since she can’t fight, she has to live alone in the woods for safety.__
*40069*__
Týr brought Odin to Jötunheim to make peace with the Giants, but Odin’s deceptions were exposed and he was cursed to never return. As Thor slaughtered the Giants of Midgard, Týr helped the survivors escape, and cut off access to their realm.__
*40070*__
When Hrungnir the Brawler fell on Thor, only young Magni and Modi had the strength to free their father. Magni got the credit, so Modi became a jerk? (Nah, they were both jerks.)__
*40071*__
Mimir used to work for a faerie king in a faraway land, until he made too much mischief. He’s been using his wits to survive for a long time…__
*40072*__
Mimir introduced himself to Odin with a “mystic well of knowledge” that made him rip out his own eye. Their relationship sounds complicated.__
*40073*__
After a long time advising Odin, Mimir came to believe he could only serve Odin by containing him and serving peace, but Odin lost trust in him and imprisoned him in the tree.__
*40074*__
Hrimthur, son of Thamur the Giant Stone Mason, disguised himself and built a wall around Asgard. Mimir thinks he built in a weakness and told only Freya about it.__

“I’ve explored every beach, cavern and ravine in the Lake of Nine, save for beyond this door. Behind it lies Konùnsgard, fabled stronghold of the Dwarven King, Mótsognir. Rumor has it he went mad while searching for some legendary armor. Unfortunately, the area is sealed by Dwarven ingenuity. If the ruins of Veithurgard are of any indication, there must be great treasure behind this door. I sought out Brok and Sindri, the fabled blacksmith Dwarves for their assistance, but they each want me to complete Favors for them in exchange for the entry stone. I’ve never completed a Favor for a Dwarf before… how hard could it be?”__

Mimir__
*43222*__
We found this strange man trapped in a tree at the summit of the Mountain. His name is Mimir, and he calls himself the smartest man alive. Or he did, until Father chopped off his head. The Witch of the Woods (who was actually the goddess Freya this whole time!) was just able to resurrect him, and now we’re taking him to talk to the World Serpent. Mimir says Jörmungandr is the only Giant left in Midgard who knows the secret rune to Jötunheim. It’s kind of weird talking to a reanimated head, but it’s nice to have someone else to talk to.__
*43223*__
World Serpent__
*43224*__
We just woke up the World Serpent of Midgard! Father thought he was going to try and eat us, but Mother always said Jörmungandr was a friendly Giant. He tried speaking to us, but I couldn’t understand him. I wonder if that’s the language all the Giants speak? He doesn’t seem very interested in us right now. I wish I could talk to him… I have so many questions! Where did he come from? What does he do all day? What does he eat? Maybe we can find another way to talk to him…__

A Thief’s Testimony__
*43820*__
“To the next poor fool to find this place,__
You’d be wiser to flee than to brave the dangers within… but count yourself lucky I came before you to unwittingly free the prior occupant, and die a fool in the process.__
I came for treasure and found only death on wings. I tried to step out of the realm, but she wouldn’t let go. It tore most terribly. The Tree bleeds for my foolishness. Her magic will surely ripple through this realm for ages, tearing at its fabric. And for what? I’m dead and she’s escaped just the same. Why did I fight it? Fool, fool, fool.__
My only solace is her jailor followed close behind. To Muspel it might have been, or Niflheim. Either way, she’ll be caught…though they’ll need a new prison… I’ve ruined this one.__
The Lindwyrm comes for me…”__

The Light Elves__
*43967*__
The Light Elves are back! We freed the Light of Alfheim from whatever the Dark Elves were doing to it, and they all returned to the temple. Everything is beautiful in Alfheim now that the Light shines free. The Light Elves seem nice. They don’t really say anything, but at least they aren’t trying to kill us. Father says I shouldn’t assume anything, but what does he know? He was doing who knows what inside the Light, while I had to take down an entire swarm of Dark Elves by myself. I don’t care what he says… I’m glad we got involved.__
*43968*__
Svartáljǫfurr__
*43969*__
We just killed the Dark Elf King that’s been harassing us this whole time. I thought I’d feel good about that, but… just before he died, he said the Light Elves were the bad guys. Could that be true? What if we’ve been fighting against the good guys this whole time? The Light Elves don’t SEEM evil, but… if they really were the ones who started this war, then maybe the Dark Elves were just fighting back? So confusing… I guess I see why Father didn’t want to get involved (but I’m not going to tell him that).__
*43970*__
Hræzlyr__
*43971*__
I can’t believe it… Father just killed a dragon! I’ve never seen him fight like that before. I mean, I know he’s really strong and all, but this thing was huge! The dragon’s name was Hræzlyr, which is sort of like the word for “Terror”. It’s an appropriate name too—he’s vicious, ugly, and shoots lightning out of his mouth. Luckily, Father was able to find some Yggdrasil tree sap crystals, and he used them to stun Hræzlyr. Then he stabbed a big crystal into his throat! There was a big explosion, and down went the dragon. I’m still shaking from the excitement, but Father doesn’t even seem fazed. Does he ever get scared?__
*43972*__
Legion__
*43973*__
Freya always seems to have more and more magic up her sleeve. First she used her roots to try to restrain Father and Baldur, but they were too strong. Then she reanimated Thamur—the Giant Stone Mason! That was incredible, but it still didn’t work. Baldur kept trying to kill Freya, and we couldn’t let that happen. So we kept fighting, and Freya summoned these weird creatures. They kept trying to grab Father to keep him from fighting. Luckily, they go down easily. There sure are a lot of them though…__
*43974*__
Valkyrie Spirits__
*43975*__
These spirits appear after we kill their physical forms, which act as some sort of prison. The spirits have no control over their bodies, which are REALLY powerful. The hardest monster we’ve ever faced, and it’s inhabited by a peaceful spirit. Go figure.__

In Search of Freyr__
*43982*__
“The Light is ours again, but there is no time to lose. Only the return of Lord Freyr can secure peace. Surely we are liberated by forces sent forth at his command, like the sword of legend. But Freyr himself remains lost, and now we must come to his aid. Some believe he has returned to Vanaheim, while others believe he is held in Asgard. Both paths are now found shut. With the temple secure, all Elf-kind is called away to seek out our lost lord.”__

The Aesir’s Punishment__
*43987*__
“Captain Erik,__
This is our fault. We managed to find a way inside one of the Asgardian Libraries you told us to stay away from, and made off with more coin in one day than we’d see from years of trading. But the thunderstorm that sank your fleet… During the tempest, I had a vision. Thor himself came to me. He appeared on the deck of the Mariusuden in a bolt of lightning, and demanded vengeance. We stole from the gods, he said, and for that, we must be punished. A brilliant flash of light followed, and then everything went dark. We awoke stranded up here. Somehow we managed to survive the shipwreck, though I imagine it is part of the Aesir’s punishment. Now we are forced to live out our last few days stranded on a cliff, surrounded by Hel-Walkers and Tatzlewurms. Starving, at each other’s throats. It won’t be long now. Will Aegir be understanding? Will Ran be compassionate? Or will they cast me out to freeze in Hel? I suppose it is not for me to know.__
I’m sorry, Captain Erik.”__

[[S:::56215-57543]]__
Get in the boat, boy.__
*100002*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s010_010_son_stem:49294-50366]]__
Found some.__
*100003*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s013_010_kra_stem:11520-12020]]__
Boy.__
*100004*__
[[S:::24030-24935]]__
That is enough.__
*100006*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s020_010_kra_stem:4450-5550]]__
That was the last.__
*100007*__
[[S:::123960-124980]]__
Find your way home.__
*100008*__
[[S:::127410-128390]]__
You are free.__
*100009*__
[[S:::206470-207070]]__
Squeeze.__
*100010*__
[[S:::212380-212980]]__
This knife...__
*100011*__
[[S:::215060-216340]]__
It was hers.__
*100012*__
[[S:::218770-219560]]__
Now it is yours.__
*100013*__
[[S:::226950-227610]]__
She taught you to hunt?__
*100014*__
[[S:::230517-231243]]__
Show me.__
*100015*__
[[S:::232900-233710]]__
Now.__
*100016*__
[[S:::258190-259500]]__
You are hunting deer.__
*100017*__
[[S:::264750-266500]]__
In the direction of deer.__
*100018*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s020_010_son_stem:43960-45730]]__
Lo, there do I see my Mother,__

[[S:::49710-51990]]__
Lo, there do I see my Father,__
*100020*__
[[S:::57470-59560]]__
Lo, there do they call to me.__

[[S:::68120-69460]]__
Lo, there do they call to me.__

[[S:::76730-78340]]__
Lo, there do they call to me.__

[[S:::79640-80930]]__
Lo, there do they call to me.__

[[S:::82600-83950]]__
Lo, there do they call to me.__

[[S:::101710-102540]]__
She’s ready.__
*100026*__
[[S:::199200-200100]]__
I’m sorry...__
*100027*__
[[S:::229638-230500]]__
What she knew.__
*100028*__
[[S:::232450-232800]]__
Now?__
*100029*__
[[S:::257390-258140]]__
What’re we hunting?__
*100030*__
[[S:::263660-264270]]__
Which way?__
*100031*__
[[S:::267790-271280]]__
Okay...? Uhh… this way—__
*100032*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s023_010_kra_stem:820-1452]]__
Boy.__
*100033*__
[[S:::2263-3248]]__
You missed these.__
*100034*__
[[S:::14680-16043]]__
Your mother taught you well.__
*100035*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s023_010_son_stem:4920-5394]]__
Huh…__
*100036*__
[[S:::5980-6470]]__
Close...__
*100037*__
[[S:::7090-8041]]__
but also not deer.__
*100038*__
[[S:::8740-9244]]__
See?__
*100039*__
[[S:::9840-10690]]__
Tips are too wide.__
*100040*__
[[S:::12420-13022]]__
Mountain goat?__
*100041*__
[[S:::19340-19956]]__
Yeah...__
*100042*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s030_010_son_stem:576-1515]]__
There it is!__
*100043*__
[[S:::17682-18757]]__
I’m sorry…__
*100044*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s030_010_kra_stem:1551-2087]]__
HOLD.__
*100045*__
[[S:::6030-7270]]__
What are you doing?__
*100046*__
[[S:::7620-11158]]__
Now its guard is up! Only fire…__
*100047*__
[[S:::12739-14048]]__
Only fire__
*100048*__
[[S:::14632-16766]]__
when I tell you to fire.__
*100049*__
[[S:::19100-20190]]__
Do not be sorry.__
*100050*__
[[S:::21280-22698]]__
Be better.__
*100051*__
[[S:::24010-24720]]__
Find it.__
*100052*__
[[S:::29790-30935]]__
Find.__
*100053*__
[[S:::31850-32561]]__
It.__
*100054*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s050_010_son_stem:5352-5871]]__
Look.__
*100055*__
[[S:::11095-12519]]__
Can I have my bow back now?__
*100056*__
[[S:::18902-20204]]__
We should get closer.__
*100057*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s050_010_kra_stem:13245-14998]]__
Can you hit it from here?__
*100058*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s060_010_kra_stem:3700-4860]]__
Wait for my mark...__
*100059*__
[[S:::6490-7281]]__
Relax.__
*100060*__
[[S:::7680-9694]]__
Do not think of it as an animal.__
*100061*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s060_030_kra_stem:3210-3710]]__
Good.__
*100062*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s060_030_son_stem:2280-2950]]__
I got it.__
*100063*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s065_010_kra_stem:5040-6702]]__
Your knife...__
*100064*__
[[S:::10793-12048]]__
No.__
*100065*__
[[S:::12310-14212]]__
Finish what you started.__
*100066*__
[[S:::82190-83637]]__
Atreus!__
*100067*__
[[S:::95320-97400]]__
We have no choice.__
*100068*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s065_010_son_stem:30070-31655]]__
I can’t…__
*100069*__
[[S:::56315-57583]]__
I…__
*100070*__
[[S:::93575-95650]]__
We’re going to fight that?!?__
*100071*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s072_010_kra_stem:18350-18860]]__
Boy!__
*100072*__
[[S:::28520-28780]]__
BOY!__
*100073*__
[[S:::29310-31030]]__
Look at me! Look at me, boy!__
*100074*__
[[S:::31470-31900]]__
Boy --__
*100075*__
[[S:::32560-33220]]__
look at me!__
*100076*__
[[S:::43200-44500]]__
You are not ready.__
*100077*__
[[S:::59600-60970]]__
We are going home.__
*100078*__
[[S:::71093-73690]]__
You are NOT ready.__
*100079*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s072_010_son_stem:15090-16100]]__
RAAAA!__
*100080*__
[[S:::16677-18300]]__
That’s what you get!__
*100081*__
[[S:::20422-22637]]__
Think I’m afraid of you?!__
*100082*__
[[S:::26313-28500]]__
You’re nothing to me!__
*100083*__
[[S:::28800-29300]]__
NOTHING!__
*100084*__
[[S:::36857-37942]]__
We DID it.__
*100085*__
[[S:::48004-48625]]__
What?__
*100086*__
[[S:::49849-51006]]__
Are you serious?__
*100087*__
[[S:::52632-53657]]__
I found the deer.__
*100088*__
[[S:::55485-56711]]__
I proved myself.__
*100089*__
[[S:::58473-59568]]__
How am I not ready?__
*100090*__
[[S:::65610-69850]]__
I haven’t been sick in a long time. I can do this.__
*100091*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s078_010_kra_stem:2290-3250]]__
Inside, boy.__
*100092*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s080_010_kra_stem:360-1410]]__
You lost control.__
*100093*__
[[S:::5560-6980]]__
Anger can be a weapon__
*100094*__
[[S:::7900-8840]]__
if you control it—__
*100095*__
[[S:::9210-9850]]__
use it.__
*100096*__
[[S:::10410-11610]]__
You clearly cannot.__
*100097*__
[[S:::12525-13050]]__
When you lose…__
*100098*__
[[S:::18340-18700]]__
Fine.__
*100099*__
[[S:::23240-24040]]__
Come on then.__
*100100*__
[[S:::26750-27700]]__
I want you to try.__
*100101*__
[[S:::33880-34460]]__
Try again.__
*100102*__
[[S:::38350-39160]]__
Too slow.__
*100103*__
[[S:::39610-40440]]__
Try again.__
*100104*__
[[S:::42230-43360]]__
Weak. Again.__
*100105*__
[[S:::44780-45050]]__
Again.__
*100106*__
[[S:::45840-46160]]__
AGAIN.__
*100107*__
[[S:::56970-62510]]__
Your anger… you can get lost in it. The path ahead is difficult__
*100108*__
[[S:::64210-67290]]__
and you, Atreus, are clearly not ready.__
*100109*__
[[S:::70850-71350]]__
QUIET.__
*100110*__
[[S:::93960-96500]]__
Boy. Beneath the floor. Now…__
*100111*__
[[S:::99390-100060]]__
I do not know.__
*100112*__
[[S:::101600-103190]]__
I do not know. Get IN.__
*100113*__
[[S:::135655-136593]]__
What do you want?__
*100114*__
[[S:::142530-144510]]__
Whatever it is you seek, I do not have it.__
*100115*__
[[S:::146940-148030]]__
You should move on.__
*100116*__
[[S:::168180-170570]]__
You do not want this fight.__
*100117*__
[[S:::182560-183660]]__
Leave__
*100118*__
[[S:::184726-185460]]__
my__
*100119*__
[[S:::187395-188540]]__
home.__
*100120*__
[[S:::202760-203970]]__
I warned you—__
*100121*__
[[S:::211050-212330]]__
You would not listen.__
*100122*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s080_010_son_stem:2004-6137]]__
That thing was trying to kill us. It’s not like you don’t get angry in a fight.__
*100123*__
[[S:::12820-16281]]__
I haven’t been sick in a long time. I’m better now.__
*100124*__
[[S:::25798-26977]]__
You want me to hit you?__
*100125*__
[[S:::32168-34056]]__
OWWW! What are you—?__
*100126*__
[[S:::37831-38787]]__
Why are you doing that?__
*100127*__
[[S:::41921-42565]]__
Cut it out!__
*100128*__
[[S:::45225-45840]]__
STOP IT!__
*100129*__
[[S:::48764-50040]]__
(slight cough)__
*100130*__
[[S:::70078-70811]]__
What was that?__
*100131*__
[[S:::88326-90371]]__
What’s going on? Do you know him?__
*100132*__
[[S:::96433-98034]]__
But… you told me never to go down there.__
*100133*__
[[S:::98699-99300]]__
Who is that?__
*100134*__
[[S:::100593-101556]]__
What's he talking about?__
*100135*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s080_010_bld_stem:80070-81600]]__
Come on out!__
*100136*__
[[S:::82930-85250]]__
It's no use hiding anymore.__
*100137*__
[[S:::86130-87810]]__
I know who you are…__
*100138*__
[[S:::90570-93920]]__
more importantly, I know what you are!__
*100139*__
[[S:::107860-113040]]__
Just tell me what I want to know! No need for this to get bloody.__
*100140*__
[[S:::122500-127340]]__
Huh. I thought you'd be bigger.__
*100141*__
[[S:::128800-131050]]__
But you’re definitely the one.__
*100142*__
[[S:::132060-134220]]__
Long way from home, aren't you?__
*100143*__
[[S:::137270-141740]]__
Oh, you already know the answer to that.__
*100144*__
[[S:::148740-154760]]__
Hahaha. And here I thought your kind was supposed to be so enlightened.__
*100145*__
[[S:::154760-158760]]__
So much better than us. So much smarter.__
*100146*__
[[S:::159790-165860]]__
And yet you hide out here in the woods—like a coward.__
*100147*__
[[S:::170510-177310]]__
Oh… I’m pretty sure I do.__
*100148*__
[[S:::189680-195370]]__
You are going to have to kill me for that to happen.__
*100149*__
[[S:::205000-206110]]__
Finally.__
*100150*__
[[S:::213340-222850]]__
No... No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.__
*100151*__
[[S:::224680-227090]]__
Fine. My turn.__
*100152*__
[[S:::241200-247910]]__
How incredibly disappointing. Come on, then.__
*100153*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s100_010_kra_stem:12500-13000]]__
Boy.__
*100154*__
[[S:::22230-23200]]__
I am all right.__
*100155*__
[[S:::25280-25800]]__
Come.__
*100156*__
[[S:::29980-31010]]__
Gather your things.__
*100157*__
[[S:::31770-32340]]__
We are leaving.__
*100158*__
[[S:::39410-43190]]__
You are not. But we have no choice now.__
*100159*__
[[S:::49210-50490]]__
Prove me wrong.__
*100160*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s100_010_son_stem:14980-17570]]__
There was so much… I thought…__
*100161*__
[[S:::20670-21640]]__
You’re all right.__
*100162*__
[[S:::37540-38800]]__
Thought I wasn’t ready.__
*100163*__
[[S:::51820-52060]]__
Yes, sir.__
*100164*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s110_010_son_stem:8490-9118]]__
Look...__
*100165*__
[[S:::10640-11591]]__
All this time...__
*100166*__
[[S:::12240-14620]]__
there’s been a protection stave around our entire woods.__
*100167*__
[[S:::15910-16400]]__
But...__
*100168*__
[[S:::17820-19110]]__
the stave’s broken there.__
*100169*__
[[S:::22570-23520]]__
Did you cut those down?__
*100170*__
[[S:::31360-32180]]__
Why’d she do that?__
*100171*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s110_010_kra_stem:25890-28400]]__
She hand-marked the trees she wished used for her pyre…__
*100172*__
[[S:::42480-42980]]__
Come.__
*100173*__
[[S:::44330-45250]]__
No looking back now.__
*100174*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s010_010_son:0-1500]]__
Still want me to tie it to the boat?__
*100179*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s020_010_son:0-397]]__
Father?__
*100180*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s020_020_kra:9-304]]__
What?__
*100181*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s020_030_son:40-890]]__
Did something change?__
*100182*__
[[S:::1890-4593]]__
The forest feels different now.__
*100183*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s020_040_kra:0-1774]]__
Everything is different, boy.__
*100184*__
[[S:::2520-3575]]__
Try not to dwell on it.__
*100185*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s020_050_son:18-503]]__
Yes, sir.__
*100186*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s030_010_son:0-500]]__
Father…__
*100187*__
[[S:::1390-2344]]__
why are we doing this now?__
*100188*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s030_020_kra:0-2000]]__
I need to know you can survive the journey.__
*100189*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s030_030_son:26-1158]]__
Then we leave for the mountain?__
*100190*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s030_040_kra:0-770]]__
Depends on you.__
*100191*__
[[S:::1700-2200]]__
Hunt.__
*100192*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s030_050_son:7-1023]]__
Father! Over here!__
*100193*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s033_010_son:68-1196]]__
Thought we were going hunting?__
*100194*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s037_010_son:172-1280]]__
What are you doing back there?__
*100195*__
[[S:::1884-3057]]__
The hunting grounds are this way.__
*100196*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s040_010_kra:22-982]]__
What did you find?__
*100197*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s040_020_son:7-548]]__
Tracks.__
*100198*__
[[S:::1340-2004]]__
Not deer though.__
*100199*__
[[S:::3002-3591]]__
I’ll keep looking.__
*100200*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s050_010_kra:0-750]]__
More tracks?__
*100201*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s050_020_son:0-500]]__
Yeah.__
*100202*__
[[S:::1000-2050]]__
But they’re too round.__
*100203*__
[[S:::2770-3540]]__
Could be a wild boar.__
*100204*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s050_030_kra:0-500]]__

It is simply a target. Clear your mind.__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s060_105_kra:115-2205]]__
Pick your spot and focus on it.__

Relax.__

Feet solid.__

Steady yourself.__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s060_150_kra:140-1000]]__
Keep that elbow up.__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s060_155_kra:77-816]]__
Breathe.__

you missed these.__

[[S:::4100-4460]]__

[[S:::5380-6190]]__
Tips are too wide.__

Mountain goat?__
*100239*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s060_030_kra:40-1250]]__
Your mother taught you well.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s065_020_son:40-1920]]__
Here. Just follow the stairs up.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s070_010_son:33-705]]__
Over here.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s071_005_son:73-1972]]__
Oop. Now what?__
*100247*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s071_010_kra:60-1020]]__
This way, boy.__
*100248*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s071_020_son:470-1490]]__
Didn’t think I’d make it.__
*100249*__

Wait.__
*100250*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s080_020_son:0-1360]]__
Deer tracks. They’re fresh.__

Aaah!__

Sorry…__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s100_020_kra:40-2500]]__
You are hunting deer—not chasing it.__
*100257*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s100_030_son:0-640]]__
Yes, father.__
*100258*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s120_010_son:0-1160]]__
He broke our bridge…__

[[S:::1700-2750]]__
how are we gonna get across?__
*100260*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s120_020_kra:15-969]]__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s120_030_son:0-650]]__
Wow.__

Oh.__

Ahh!__
*100266*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s130_020_son:0-570]]__
My bow!__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s130_030_kra:0-500]]__
No!__

[[S:::850-2900]]__
You are not ready—stay back!__
*100269*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s130_040_son:11-1189]]__
Father! Above you!__
*100270*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s140_010_son:50-650]]__
Draugr?__
*100271*__
[[S:::1600-3480]]__
They’ve never come this close to our woods before.__
*100272*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s140_030_kra:20-660]]__
Keep moving.__
*100273*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s142_010_son:120-3295]]__
Uh... deer’s this way. I can see more tracks.__
*100274*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s142_020_son:20-1193]]__
...or we can follow you.__
*100275*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s150_010_kra:110-1000]]__
Mind the edge, boy.__
*100276*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s160_010_son:20-970]]__
That hanging bucket,__
*100277*__
[[S:::2050-2940]]__
an offering cask?__
*100278*__
[[S:::4140-7956]]__
Mother said Odin’s disciples fill them with gifts and hang them where thieves can’t reach them.__
*100279*__
[[S:::8590-9659]]__
That one looked really old.__
*100280*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s160_010_son_a:30-1010]]__
That hanging bucket.__
*100281*__
[[S:::1730-2880]]__
Is that an offering cask?__
*100282*__
[[S:::4100-8012]]__
Mother said Odin’s disciples fill them with gifts and hang them where thieves can’t reach them.__
*100283*__

That one looked really old.__
*100284*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s160_020_kra:36-731]]__
Foolish…__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s160_030_son:40-630]]__
What is?__
*100286*__
[[S:::1420-2452]]__
Worshipping the gods?__
*100287*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s160_040_kra:100-1800]]__
The gods care nothing for them.__
*100288*__
[[S:::2330-4250]]__
Men should not pray to monsters.__
*100289*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s200_010_son:9-888]]__
They were just hungry.__
*100290*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s200_020_kra:6-330]]__
What?__
*100291*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s200_030_son:0-1714]]__
The wolves. They weren’t mean.__
*100292*__
[[S:::2040-2794]]__
They were starving.__
*100293*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s200_040_kra:30-570]]__
Yes.__
*100294*__
[[S:::1150-2299]]__
I imagine they were.__
*100295*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s203_010_son:50-1000]]__
Should we be in here?__
*100296*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s203_020_kra:150-3000]]__
We do what we please boy, no excuses.__
*100297*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s210_010_son:34-4933]]__
Up there! He went in the old temple. But Mom told me never to go in there.__
*100298*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s210_011_kra:50-3000]]__
We do what we please, boy. No excuses.__

Up there!__
*100300*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s210_010_son_b:130-2950]]__
He went in the old temple. But Mom told me never to go in there.__
*100301*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s210_020_son:0-3049]]__
You know… mother taught me some magic for my bow too.__
*100302*__
[[S:::3660-4960]]__
I can help you fight.__

[[S:::5540-6139]]__
I’m ready.__
*100304*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s210_030_kra:0-1240]]__
You have yet to prove that.__
*100305*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s215_010_son:40-4819]]__
Over there… he went in the old temple, but you told me never to come here.__
*100306*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s215_020_kra:50-1340]]__
You are with me now.__

[[S:::1890-2750]]__
No excuses.__
*100308*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s220_010_son:50-2130]]__
I went hunting with mother a bunch of times.__

[[S:::2880-4110]]__

Why now?__
*100314*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s220_020_kra:140-950]]__
It was her wish.__
*100315*__
[[S:::1700-2370]]__
And…__
*100316*__
[[S:::2920-3500]]__
it was time.__
*100317*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s220_030_son:4-297]]__
Okay.__
*100318*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s230_010_son:29-2290]]__
Ugh… It stinks.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s232_010_son:77-599]]__
What was that?__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s232_010_son_a:51-555]]__
What was that?__
*100321*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s232_020_kra:90-1140]]__
It does not matter.__
*100322*__
[[S:::1580-2500]]__
Stay focused.__
*100323*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s235_010_son:20-940]]__
Is that a coffin?__

[[S:::1770-2350]]__
Out here?__
*100325*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s240_010_son:29-3124]]__
Whew. I half-expected there to be a troll under that bridge.__

You are not ready for trolls, boy.__

Yes father.__

Yes father.__

Something’s gotta open that gate…__

Huh… won’t stay open. What now?__
*100333*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s250_040_son:7-1457]]__
Is that big gear up there made of wood?__
*100334*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s250_050_son:0-1140]]__
You froze it in place.__
*100335*__
[[S:::1600-2100]]__

[[S:::2824-4321]]__
Think you could’ve frozen Draugr with it?__
*100337*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s250_050_son_a:0-1140]]__
You froze it in place.__

Clever.__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s250_051_kra:120-2250]]__
No. It does not work like that.__

[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s137b_010_son_stem:1280-2900]]__
But… I hit it. Didn’t I?__
*100755*__
[[S:::3470-5540]]__
I did what you said and it looked like it bounced off.__
*100756*__
[[S:::6600-7930]]__
Could the boar be magical?__
*100757*__
[[S:::12670-14500]]__
It looked weirder than any boar I’ve ever seen…__
*100758*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s137b_010_kra_stem:7940-8440]]__
Hunh.__
*100759*__
[[S:::11100-11840]]__
What do you think?__
*100760*__
[[S:::15050-15950]]__
Get after it then.__
*100761*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s140_010_son_stem:11440-11990]]__
I got it.__
*100762*__
[[S:::14830-15460]]__
Elbow up.__
*100763*__
[[S:::16000-16850]]__
Steady hand.__
*100764*__
[[S:::17430-18240]]__
Relax…__
*100765*__
[[S:::19460-20700]]__
accuracy over speed…__
*100766*__
[[S:::23200-23700]]__
YES!__
*100767*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s140_010_kra_stem:24440-25170]]__
Do not lose it!__
*100768*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s150a_010_son_stem:9095-10567]]__
We didn’t know he belonged to anyone.__
*100769*__
[[S:::26075-27101]]__
Target practice…__
*100770*__
[[S:::30097-31858]]__
I’m so so sorry...__
*100771*__
[[S:::35354-36327]]__
Will he die?__
*100772*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s150a_010_kra_stem:13292-14961]]__
The boy was following my command.__
*100773*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s150a_010_fre_stem:10750-12470]]__
He doesn’t. He’s my friend.__
*100774*__
[[S:::16320-17460]]__
Then help fix this.__
*100775*__
[[S:::17730-19340]]__
Hold here please.__
*100776*__
[[S:::19340-20700]]__
HOLD, I said. He’s losing blood.__
*100777*__
[[S:::21710-24030]]__
The last of his kind in all the realm and you shoot him.__
*100778*__
[[S:::24440-25310]]__
You needed food?__
*100779*__
[[S:::28020-29340]]__
Target practice...__
*100780*__
[[S:::31720-33010]]__
Keep that pressure on.__
*100781*__
[[S:::33010-34870]]__
The blame is mine. I should have kept a closer eye.__
*100782*__
[[S:::36323-37618]]__
I will not let him.__
*100783*__
[[S:::37707-42798]]__
You—the arrow cut a tideway inside him. Find both ends and hold them tightly.__
*100784*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s150b_010_fre_stem:1430-3020]]__
Sunnan-__
*100785*__
[[S:::3781-5821]]__
þoka.__
*100786*__
[[S:::12460-13880]]__
I can’t finish the healing here.__
*100787*__
[[S:::14430-15960]]__
My home is just beyond the trees there.__
*100788*__
[[S:::16480-17390]]__
You’ll carry him?__
*100789*__
[[S:::21150-22700]]__
He must not die.__
*100790*__
[[S:::27070-29540]]__
Good. He seems stable and calm for now.__
*100791*__
[[S:::32460-34707]]__
Greiða!__
*100792*__
[[S:::37000-37727]]__
This way.__
*100793*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s150b_010_son_stem:10698-11974]]__
You’re a witch…__
*100794*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s150b_010_kra_stem:24195-26086]]__
Hrmmmm…__
*100795*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s150c_010_fre:880-3250]]__
Start with the left side. Grab it and hold.__
*100796*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s150c_020_fre:760-2500]]__
Now the right side. Hold it tight.__
*100797*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s150c_030_fre:640-2250]]__
Please—keep a steady grip.__
*100798*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s150c_040_fre:470-2500]]__
Grab and hold the left end of the tideway.__
*100799*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s150c_050_fre:440-2500]]__
You need to grab and hold both ends.__
*100800*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s150c_060_son:140-1215]]__
Father, please!__
*100801*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s150c_070_fre:190-2750]]__
Good. Now pull them together—line them up.__
*100802*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s160_010_fre_stem:630-1850]]__
Place him on the stave there.__
*100803*__
[[S:::6290-7310]]__
Keep him still.__
*100804*__
[[S:::16030-16760]]__
It’s better this way.__
*100805*__
[[S:::21790-23430]]__
Hold him still-before he hurts himself.__
*100806*__
[[S:::24990-25668]]__
Good.__
*100807*__
[[S:::28470-28970]]__
Easy…__
*100808*__
[[S:::30260-31280]]__
rest now…__
*100809*__
[[S:::33540-37990]]__
I need two more things. Fresh red root grows just behind the house. Can you pull a cluster?__
*100810*__
[[S:::48524-49187]]__
I…__
*100811*__
[[S:::52500-54229]]__
I know you’re a god.__
*100812*__
[[S:::55570-57610]]__
Not of this realm, but there’s no mistaking it.__
*100813*__
[[S:::59830-64500]]__
He doesn’t know, does he? About your true nature—or his own?__
*100814*__
[[S:::65590-70400]]__
The gods of these realms don’t take kindly to outsiders. Trust me, I know.__
*100815*__
[[S:::71030-75460]]__
When they find you—and they will—they’ll make things difficult.__
*100816*__
[[S:::76450-78000]]__
The boy will want answers.__
*100817*__
[[S:::79290-82170]]__
Whatever you’re hiding, you cannot protect him forever.__
*100818*__
[[S:::83690-84871]]__
But you’re right…__
*100819*__
[[S:::86420-87710]]__
… doesn’t concern me.__
*100820*__
[[S:::90230-92149]]__
I also need Lamb's Cress. Do you mind?__
*100821*__
[[S:::92839-95637]]__
It’s a white-petaled flower in my garden. Just a handful.__
*100822*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s160_010_son_stem:13370-14060]]__
You live alone?__
*100823*__
[[S:::17090-19080]]__
Yeah, my father doesn’t like people either.__
*100824*__
[[S:::19700-20760]]__
Well, you don’t.__
*100825*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s160_010_kra_stem:19080-19600]]__
Boy.__
*100826*__
[[S:::45010-45580]]__
What else?__
*100827*__
[[S:::64050-65370]]__
That is none of your concern.__
*100828*__
[[S:::77570-79010]]__
That will be my problem.__
*100829*__
[[S:::99300-99910]]__
Fine.__
*100830*__
[[S:::101030-102000]]__
Lamb’s Cress…__
*100831*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s163_010_kra_stem:4840-5620]]__
Would this help?__
*100832*__
[[S:::11080-12480]]__
When you were chasing the animal.__
*100833*__
[[S:::18540-19880]]__
You did lose it.__
*100834*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s163_010_son_stem:9830-10730]]__
I dropped it…?__
*100835*__
[[S:::13870-15070]]__
What’s wrong with me?__
*100836*__
[[S:::17020-18640]]__
If I… if I’d lost it…__
*100837*__
[[S:::25420-27132]]__
I’ll take better care of it from now on.__
*100838*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s165_010_fre_stem:15766-17677]]__
Ah, exactly what I need.__
*100839*__
[[S:::26470-27000]]__
Yes.__
*100840*__
[[S:::30560-31060]]__
Wait…__
*100841*__
[[S:::32770-33680]]__
Not without thanks.__
*100842*__
[[S:::42870-43830]]__
You want solitude?__
*100843*__
[[S:::44960-46300]]__
This mark will hide you from__
*100844*__
[[S:::48800-50840]]__
those who might make your journey… difficult.__
*100845*__
[[S:::57100-58150]]__
Leyna.__
*100846*__
[[S:::68880-69970]]__
Leyna.__
*100847*__
[[S:::72970-73902]]__
Heimili!__
*100848*__
[[S:::78345-82647]]__
There’s a shortcut below the house that leads safely out of these woods.__
*100849*__
[[S:::83159-84888]]__
Follow this path down,__
*100850*__
[[S:::85435-86816]]__
then head towards daylight.__
*100851*__
[[S:::94303-96432]]__
As much or as little as you like.__
*100852*__
[[S:::97308-98267]]__
Now get out of here.__
*100853*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s165_010_son_stem:24196-25517]]__
So he’s going to live?__
*100854*__
[[S:::91203-92579]]__
Will we see you again?__
*100855*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s165_010_kra_stem:29030-30020]]__
Then we are leaving.__
*100856*__
[[S:::99620-100588]]__
Come, boy.__
*100857*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s010_010_son:0-929]]__
They don’t see us.__
*100858*__
[[S:::1550-2250]]__
Should I fire?__
*100859*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s010_020_kra:30-1250]]__
Wait for my mark.__
*100860*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s010_030_son:27-1085]]__
Are we going to attack?__
*100861*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s010_040_son:18-1006]]__
What are we waiting for?__
*100862*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s010_050_son:25-734]]__
Why aren’t we—__
*100863*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s010_060_kra:30-2090]]__
Be silent and do not question me.__
*100864*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s020_010_son:0-1400]]__
How was that? Did I help?__
*100865*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s020_020_kra:0-1010]]__
If you want to help,__
*100866*__
[[S:::1400-2080]]__
distract them.__
*100867*__
[[S:::2430-6500]]__
Whoever is not my focus should be yours… but only when safe to do so.__
*100868*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s020_030_son:0-490]]__
I can do that.__
*100869*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s020_040_son:0-500]]__
Anything else?__
*100870*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s020_050_kra:0-2750]]__
Space your shots. Speed costs accuracy.__
*100871*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s020_060_son:5-303]]__
Got it.__
*100872*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s040_010_son:10-1371]]__
Two more! Over there!__
*100873*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s050_010_son:0-500]]__
How was that?__
*100874*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s050_020_kra:0-500]]__
Better.__
*100875*__
[[S:::1090-2150]]__
But keep your distance.__
*100876*__
[[S:::2750-3650]]__
Give me space.__
*100877*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s050_030_son:0-750]]__
And take my time.__
*100878*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s050_040_kra:5-556]]__
Correct.__
*100879*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s060_010_son:6-466]]__
Look there…__
*100880*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s060_020_son:119-5201]]__
(murmured reading)__
*100881*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s060_021_son:16-1214]]__
There’s a Jötnar settlement ahead…__
*100882*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s060_030_kra:9-617]]__
Jötnar?__
*100883*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s060_040_son:8-481]]__
Giants.__
*100884*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s060_050_kra:0-940]]__
You can read the writing?__
*100885*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s060_060_son_a:110-610]]__
Some—__
*100886*__
[[S:::1610-2810]]__
just the languages mother knew.__
*100887*__
[[S:::3800-6500]]__
They’re all sort of connected, so I can kind of piece it together.__
*100888*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s060_060_son:0-2500]]__
Some— just the languages mother knew.__
*100889*__
[[S:::3180-7847]]__
But they’re all sort of connected so sometimes I can feel my way through stuff I shouldn’t know. Ya know?__
*100890*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s110_010_kra:20-2445]]__
Remember: Accuracy over speed!__
*100891*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s111_010_son:30-2150]]__
That was the last one. Was I better?__
*100892*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s111_020_kra:0-1250]]__
Take even more time.__
*100893*__
[[S:::1740-4010]]__
It does not matter if you fire only once.__
*100894*__
[[S:::4680-5500]]__
Show me control.__
*100895*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s112_010_son:8-538]]__
Look at this…__
*100896*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s112_020_kra:0-477]]__
Read it.__
*100897*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s112_031_son:0-500]]__
Oh.__
*100898*__
[[S:::790-2030]]__
This used to be a marketplace.__
*100899*__
[[S:::2560-5710]]__
The Giants used to gather here to trade with the gods a long time ago.__
*100900*__
[[S:::6310-7450]]__
Wonder if Odin was ever here…__
*100901*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s113_030_son:18-1198]]__
There’s something up there!__

Above us! Something’s breaking through the wall!__

Something’s breaking through the wall! Up there!__

Something’s breaking through the wall!__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s114_010_son:0-1420]]__
I guess we need to get back up there.__

[[S:::1970-2500]]__
But how?__
*100910*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s114_020_kra:12-872]]__
Follow me.__
*100911*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s115a_010_son:14-2020]]__
Look—there’s an opening up there.__

Right up there… Look—an opening.__

Uh… do you hear that? What is it?__

Stay close.__

What is that?__

Doesn’t sound like a good thing…__

Wait… you don’t suppose Revenant travel in packs, do you?__

[[S:::3664-5567]]__
And there’s a bunch of ’em waiting up there for us?__

[[S:::5997-6825]]__
And they’re really mad?__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s119b_020_kra:0-637]]__
Boy.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119b_030_son:0-590]]__
Sorry.__

[[S:::1080-1894]]__

Earlier...__

[[S:::890-3910]]__
you said people might try and rob us. I’ll kill them if they try.__

You will stay out of it, boy.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s123_010_son:27-2793]]__
I still don’t understand why that man attacked you at our house.__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s123_020_kra:30-2500]]__
I told you, boy, I know nothing more of it.__

Hey… I think there’s a chest over there.__

Father! Behind you!__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119c_010_son:40-1450]]__
I see stuff on the other side…__
*100957*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119c_020_son:0-1250]]__
Gotta be a way to drop the bridge…__
*100958*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119c_030_son:0-1250]]__
Wish we could break that chain.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119c_040_son:0-1400]]__
Chains on both sides maybe?__
*100960*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119c_050_son:0-1250]]__
Maybe each side has a chain?__
*100961*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s119c_060_kra:50-1500]]__
Now back to the bridge outside.__
*100962*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119c_070_son:70-2800]]__
Hey, maybe the way out’s through that draw bridge back there—__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119d_005_son:30-900]]__
This should get us across…__

Something’s resetting the bridge…__

Oh, I bet that weight is resetting it.__

See there—under the bridge?__
*100972*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119d_051_son:0-1900]]__
There’s gotta be some way to get rid of that weight…__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119d_060_son:69-724]]__
You did it.__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s119d_060_kra:0-1000]]__
Let me focus.__
*100975*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119e_010_son:30-800]]__
All these dead…__

[[S:::1280-2310]]__
you think it’s safe in there?__
*100977*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s119e_020_kra:120-1400]]__
You think it safer out here?__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s120a_010_kra:110-750]]__
It is finished.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s120a_020_son:0-750]]__
I want to leave here.__

Then collect yourself.__

We must find a way out.__

There is always a way out…__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s120a_050_kra:78-768]]__
That chain…__

Okay.__

Okay.__

the chain.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s120b_020_son:0-500]]__
The chain,__

You are in your head, boy.__

Let it go.__

He would have killed you.__

I know. I had to do it—__

I do know that. It’s just…__

*101009*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s120b_070_kra:0-1420]]__

[[S:::1820-5650]]__
To be effective in combat, a warrior must not feel for his enemy.__

[[S:::9150-10500]]__

The tree with the white trunk and orange leaves—__

right there on the other side of the bridge.__

we’re back here again.__

Hey, look at that!__
*101095*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_020_son:30-714]]__
What is it…?__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_030_kra:0-400]]__
Boy…__
*101097*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_040_son:92-2175]]__
Look, there are runes written along the side.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_050_son:70-1250]]__
Do you want me to read these runes?__
*101099*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_060_kra:0-750]]__
What does it say?__
*101100*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_070_son:0-820]]__
"As we are,__

As I alone can never be."__

A riddle?__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_100_kra:40-580]]__
Boy,__

what do those runes say?__
*101107*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_110_son:0-740]]__
It says__
*101108*__
[[S:::1350-2290]]__
“Family”…__
*101109*__
[[S:::3270-4610]]__
what are we supposed to do with that?__
*101110*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_111_kra:140-710]]__
Boy,__

[[S:::1590-2750]]__
what do those runes say?__

Ooooh…__

it says__

[[S:::2170-2920]]__
“Family”.__
*101115*__
[[S:::3690-4680]]__
That’s not a clue.__
*101116*__
[[S:::5310-6090]]__
It’s the answer!__

[[S:::6590-8580]]__
What “I alone can never be” —__

[[S:::9540-9885]]__
right?__
*101119*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_113_kra:0-1749]]__
What do the runes on the bowl say?__
*101120*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_114_son:0-820]]__
“As we are,__

What do those runes say?__
*101124*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_115_kra:0-500]]__
A riddle?__
*101125*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_116_son:0-540]]__
Oh!__
*101126*__
[[S:::1172-3600]]__
And “Family” must be the answer!__
*101127*__
[[S:::4420-6120]]__
What “I alone can never be”—__
*101128*__
[[S:::6800-7300]]__
right?__
*101129*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_120_kra:150-2250]]__
Use your knife, and trace the runes into the sand.__
*101130*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_130_son:22-512]]__
Really?__

Kynslóð…__
*101135*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_150_son:8-946]]__
Something happened!__
*101136*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_160_son:60-737]]__
It worked!__
*101137*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_170_son:20-2129]]__
Seems like maybe those rings should be turning.__
*101138*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_180_son:33-2227]]__
The rings are turning! Come back down.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_190_son:9-2692]]__
Oh, bet you could freeze those gears, if you wanted to.__

Hm… still doesn’t look like anything.__

So close!__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_220_son:0-1250]]__
May need to try that again.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_230_son:7-855]]__
Not sure that’s it.__
*101144*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_240_son:2-2008]]__
Keep trying, we’ve almost got it.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_250_son:2-1048]]__
I’m still not seeing it.__

Hey! That looks right!__

I think that part’s right!__

Good!__

Oop—now it’s wrong again.__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s137_010_kra:0-500]]__
Boy,__
*101154*__
[[S:::850-1450]]__
the stone.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s137_020_son:35-508]]__
Oh.__
*101156*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s161_010_son:44-839]]__
Wow…__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s163_010_kra:70-2000]]__
Boy… I hear your animal ahead.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s163_020_son:101-1239]]__
I knew it was a boar!__
*101159*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s170_010_son:0-1250]]__
What’ll we do once we find it?__
*101160*__
[[S:::2150-4892]]__
I drew to my chest like you said and it still didn’t pierce its hide.__
*101161*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s170_020_kra:0-1638]]__
You shot the animal’s flank.__
*101162*__
[[S:::1997-4581]]__
Next time aim for the soft of its belly.__
*101163*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s170_030_son:0-500]]__
I understand.__
*101164*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s180_010_kra:0-750]]__
Stay alert.__
*101165*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s180_011_son:0-930]]__
More of those people?__
*101166*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s180_012_kra:0-750]]__
Something else.__
*101167*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s180_013_son:0-2099]]__
Some of the bodies are those weird dead things.__
*101168*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s180_020_son:125-3319]]__
There’s Draugr here too. They must have been fighting?__

Ready?__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s185_010_son:38-1201]]__
AHH! Another one!__

I’m sorry!__

[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_010_fre:0-1750]]__
That bow’s a little big for you, isn’t it?__
*101192*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_020_son:0-870]]__
My mother made it for me.__

[[S:::1650-2546]]__
Said I’d grow into it.__
*101194*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_030_fre:0-1829]]__
I’ve never seen you in these woods.__

[[S:::2500-4500]]__
She must miss you being away from home.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_040_son:0-506]]__
She…__

she’s dead.__

Ashes?__
*101200*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_070_son:20-940]]__
It was her last wish.__

You live in a tree?__

I promise you, he’s safe.__

Quickly.__
*101216*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s220b_010_fre:0-640]]__
The Lamb’s Cress…__
*101217*__
[[S:::1230-1810]]__
Please.__
*101218*__
[[S:::2350-3250]]__
Time is critical.__
*101219*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s220b_020_fre:0-3790]]__
I beg you—without the Lamb’s Cress from the garden I won’t be able to save him.__

[[S:::4300-5000]]__
Please hurry…!__
*101221*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s220c_010_fre:0-990]]__
Lamb’s Cress. Good.__
*101222*__
[[S:::1550-2750]]__
Have you the Red Root as well?__
*101223*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s220c_020_kra:130-1000]]__
The boy is searching.__
*101224*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s220c_030_fre:0-1140]]__
Perhaps he could use help.__
*101225*__
[[S:::1670-4000]]__
Please, the salve is nothing without both ingredients.__
*101226*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s220c_040_kra:86-835]]__
Hhhnnmm.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s230_010_son:4-3141]]__
I like her. I mean, she lives under a turtle!__

You are too open with her.__

[[S:::2130-3750]]__
We do not know if she can be trusted.__
*101230*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s230_030_son:0-1174]]__
She hasn’t tried to kill us.__
*101231*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s230_040_kra:0-466]]__
Yet.__
*101232*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s230_050_son:0-3353]]__
Can you help? I can’t quite… get it…__
*101233*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s235_010_fre:440-1430]]__
Red Root. Good.__
*101234*__
[[S:::1900-2750]]__
Have you the Lamb’s Cress?__
*101235*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s235_020_kra:40-495]]__
No.__
*101236*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s235_030_son:0-960]]__
He stopped to help me.__
*101237*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s235_040_fre:0-2500]]__
Please, the salve is nothing without both ingredients.__
*101238*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s240_010_fre:160-4030]]__
This underground passage should put you back on your path to the mountain.__
*101239*__
[[S:::4680-5500]]__
Just use the boat.__

[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s240_020_fre:150-650]]__
Wait.__

[[S:::1190-1750]]__
And take this…__

[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s240_030_fre:120-2980]]__
You can use it to orient yourself and navigate the world.__

[[S:::3600-5750]]__
It will always steer you towards your goals.__
*101244*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s240_040_fre:200-3350]]__
And if you care to cleanse this cavern of the Revenant who’ve overrun it,__

you have my gratitude.__

[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_020_fre:0-1090]]__
He needs rest…__

[[S:::1470-2750]]__
but I think he’s out of danger.__
*101250*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_030_son:50-750]]__
Does he have a name?__

[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_040_fre:0-850]]__
Hildisvíni.__

He’s been a good friend for a long time.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_050_son:60-1470]]__
I’ve never seen a boar like him.__

You said he was the last in the realm?__

[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_060_fre:0-1390]]__
The last in this realm.__
*101256*__
[[S:::2030-3900]]__
He’s from somewhere else entirely.__
*101257*__
[[S:::4550-8570]]__
Back home he could take any form he liked… but since he came here, he’s been…__
*101258*__
[[S:::9270-9780]]__
stuck.__
*101259*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_070_son:20-996]]__
Stuck as a boar?__
*101260*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_080_fre:0-1010]]__
Stuck in his mind.__
*101261*__
[[S:::1740-5685]]__
His own true nature grows faint in his memory, like a dream…__
*101262*__
[[S:::6300-8750]]__
while the illusion feels more real every passing day.__
*101263*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_090_son:60-1427]]__
Not sure I understand.__
*101264*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_100_fre:60-770]]__
To live…__
*101265*__
[[S:::1230-5490]]__
simply to live, in your physical form, day after day…__
*101266*__
[[S:::5860-8510]]__
it’s hard to resist believing you are your form.__
*101267*__
[[S:::8960-13560]]__
In youth, he might have had the strength to rebel… but Hildisvíni is very, very old.__
*101268*__
[[S:::13920-15590]]__
Without me to remind him of home—__
*101269*__
[[S:::16470-17460]]__
of himself—__
*101270*__
[[S:::18090-20000]]__
I fear the Boar is all that will remain.__
*101271*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_110_son:0-2757]]__
Well, I hope he finds his way home.__
*101272*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_120_fre:0-680]]__
Thank you, child.__
*101273*__
[[S:::1410-2000]]__
I do too.__
*101274*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s246_010_son:88-919]]__
I see a boat.__
*101275*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s246_020_son:88-2539]]__
Can’t reach the boat from here. Maybe another way?__
*101276*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s246b_010_kra:0-1250]]__
Do not touch the water.__
*101277*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s246b_020_son:0-489]]__
Why?__
*101278*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s246b_030_kra:50-1750]]__
Do you know what is under the surface?__
*101279*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s246b_040_son:0-500]]__
No,__
*101280*__
[[S:::1220-2000]]__
it’s pitch black.__
*101281*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s246b_050_kra:95-1802]]__
Then do not touch the water.__
*101282*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s247_010_son:60-896]]__
Isn’t that heavy?__
*101283*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s247_020_kra:50-601]]__
Yes.__
*101284*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s247_030_son:60-1093]]__
Doesn’t seem heavy…__
*101285*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s247_040_kra:47-511]]__
Here.__
*101286*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s247b_010_son:0-500]]__
Hey,__
*101287*__
[[S:::930-3130]]__
I think I see another one of those bowls of sand up there—__
*101288*__
[[S:::3930-5040]]__
that I drew the runes into?__
*101289*__
[[S:::5840-7000]]__
Not sure how we reach it though.__
*101290*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s247b_020_son:0-1400]]__
Bet I could reach that with some help.__
*101291*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s247b_030_son:0-2500]]__
Okay, well, that’s way too far to jump.__
*101292*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s247b_031_son:98-2795]]__
Bring that block closer, and I’ll jump to it. Probably.__
*101293*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s247b_040_son:0-750]]__
This’ll be fun.__
*101294*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s247b_050_son:70-350]]__
Whoa!__
*101295*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s247b_060_son:44-713]]__
Almost there!__
*101296*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s247b_070_son:50-2222]]__
I can’t jump over with those wooden boards in the way…__
*101297*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_010_son:0-500]]__
Hey,__
*101298*__
[[S:::760-2340]]__
I think I see another sand bowl up there—__
*101299*__
[[S:::3170-4270]]__
that I drew the runes into?__
*101300*__
[[S:::5060-6250]]__
Not sure how we reach it though.__
*101301*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_020_son:83-2901]]__
It is! It’s another one of those sand bowls.__
*101302*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_030_son:60-2200]]__
There are different runes written along the side of this one…__
*101303*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_040_kra:0-750]]__
What does it say?__
*101304*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_050_son:50-720]]__
Another riddle.__
*101305*__
[[S:::1630-2330]]__
“Feed me not,__
*101306*__
[[S:::3000-3890]]__
we both are doomed /__
*101307*__
[[S:::4900-5760]]__
Overfeed me,__
*101308*__
[[S:::6370-7250]]__
all consumed.”__
*101309*__
[[S:::9280-9734]]__
Hmmm…__
*101310*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_060_kra:80-1260]]__
The answer might be near,__
*101311*__
[[S:::1720-2250]]__
like the other.__
*101312*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_070_son:70-495]]__
Wait,__
*101313*__
[[S:::1340-2500]]__
I think I see runes up there,__
*101314*__
[[S:::3400-4536]]__
but it’s too dark to see.__
*101315*__
[[S:::5168-5724]]__
See that?__
*101316*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_080_son:4-2840]]__
The answer’s gotta be written around here somewhere, right?__
*101317*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_090_son:0-500]]__
Wait,__
*101318*__
[[S:::900-2435]]__
I think I see something on the ceiling.__
*101319*__
[[S:::3298-4982]]__
But it’s blocked by those wooden boards.__
*101320*__
[[S:::5902-6395]]__
See there?__
*101321*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_100_son:72-1423]]__
What do we have that glows?__
*101322*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_110_son:69-1640]]__
Ha! I see it now!__
*101323*__
[[S:::2030-2930]]__
It says “Fire.”__
*101324*__
[[S:::3490-4070]]__
Of course…__
*101325*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_120_kra:0-1250]]__
Draw the runes in the sand.__
*101326*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_130_son:40-940]]__
Okay, wait.__
*101327*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_140_son:52-598]]__
Bál__
*101328*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_150_son:0-1125]]__
Whoa! That did it..!__
*101329*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_160_kra:0-750]]__
Stay there!__
*101330*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_170_son:0-750]]__
Come on over!__
*101331*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s160a_010_kra:80-2750]]__
It is important for a warrior to keep his skills sharp.__
*101332*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv02_s015_010_son:90-590]]__
Wait…__
*101333*__
[[S:::1000-1700]]__
this is wrong.__
*101334*__
[[S:::2160-2966]]__
Where’s the sand bowl?__
*101335*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv02_s015_020_kra:60-1069]]__
The water dropped.__
*101336*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv02_s015_030_son:80-2020]]__
When the serpent rose. Right.__
*101337*__
[[S:::2690-3250]]__
I knew that.__
*101338*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv02_s020_010_son:50-600]]__
Um,__
*101339*__
[[S:::1250-2380]]__
so I was wondering…__
*101340*__
[[S:::3000-4250]]__
why do you live under a turtle?__
*101341*__
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_riv02_s020_020_fre:1870-4190]]__
He was my first friend here in Midgard.__
*101342*__
[[S:::4660-10120]]__
He offered me shelter, and in return, I provide him with protection against the evils of the forest.__
*101343*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv02_s020_030_son:50-2120]]__
Golden boar, giant turtle…__
*101344*__
[[S:::2720-4250]]__
you sure have some interesting friends!__
*101345*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv02_s020_040_son:50-890]]__
See you later!__
*101346*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv02_s020_050_fre:7-759]]__
Be safe.__
*101347*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv02_s030_010_son:25-1678]]__
Can we get out of this place?__
*101348*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv02_s030_010_son_a:49-1376]]__
Can we get out of this place?__
*101349*__
[[S::vo_lvl_fthl01_s185_010_son_stem:6020-6660]]__
Whoa...__
*101350*__
[[S:::7410-8680]]__
Sure is foggy here.__
*101351*__
[[S:::14800-15690]]__
Another Dwarf,__
*101352*__
[[S:::16260-16950]]__
should we—?__
*101353*__
[[S:::53640-54820]]__
It was my mother’s.__
*101354*__
[[S:::56270-57980]]__
She left it to father before she died.__
*101355*__
[[S:::85350-85850]]__
But...__
*101356*__
[[S:::86790-88150]]__
nobody asked you to...__
*101357*__
[[S:::101150-103810]]__
I knew it! You are Brok’s brother!__
*101358*__
[[S:::104800-106180]]__
The other half of the brand’s here...__
*101359*__
[[S:::160230-161420]]__
So what were you working on?__
*101360*__
[[S:::172390-173350]]__
And you know how to fix it?__
*101361*__
[[S::vo_lvl_fthl01_s185_010_sin_stem:20660-25080]]__
Excuse me, but... how did you come by that axe?__
*101362*__
[[S:::27030-31000]]__
And while I won’t dispute that... I know that blade.__
*101363*__
[[S:::31000-35340]]__
It was one of ours. But we didn’t make it for you.__
*101364*__
[[S:::38090-44360]]__
I can’t. See, the woman we made it for... I was, well... I am... quite fond of her.__
*101365*__
[[S:::44360-51360]]__
And I would be somewhat ...displeased if it turns out that ...you did something to her.__
*101366*__
[[S:::62360-63320]]__
Faye’s dead?__
*101367*__
[[S:::66050-68040]]__
I’m... very, very sorry to hear that.__
*101368*__
[[S:::70690-74510]]__
She was a fierce warrior... and a good woman.__
*101369*__
[[S:::79510-84180]]__
Okay... I will make improvements to the axe.__
*101370*__
[[S:::89690-96430]]__
True. But knowing your mother, she would have insisted I repair that act of vandalism__
*101371*__
[[S:::96430-101080]]__
perpetrated against her axe by my brother.__
*101372*__
[[S:::112260-118960]]__
Yes, though my talents are vastly superior. No boast—swear to Freya.__
*101373*__
[[S:::131760-137000]]__
Yeeeah... but can you put it down over there? That handle is -__
*101374*__
[[S:::137800-139720]]__
filthy…__
*101375*__
[[S:::141300-146080]]__
Okay, then... I’ll just… I will just...__
*101376*__
[[S:::157040-159550]]__
Ugh… is that dried blood?__
*101377*__
[[S:::162100-168820]]__
Oh, that… I call it the “Sky Mover.” Just up that mountain waits a treasure trove of rare resources.__
*101378*__
[[S:::168820-172200]]__
Once I mine it, I’ll need a way to bring it all down…__
*101379*__
[[S:::174080-175380]]__
Not even a little.__
*101380*__
[[S::vo_lvl_fthl01_s185_010_kra_stem:16630-17210]]__
No.__
*101381*__
[[S:::17900-19380]]__
He is of no consequence.__
*101382*__
[[S:::25010-26430]]__
That is my concern alone.__
*101383*__
[[S:::36460-37430]]__
Step aside.__
*101384*__
[[S:::109020-110950]]__
The blue one is your brother?__
*101385*__
[[S:::125740-129000]]__
Do not undo his work. Improve upon it only.__
*101386*__
[[S:::137000-137720]]__
No.__
*101387*__
[[S::vo_lvl_fthl01_s187_010_son_stem:16846-18461]]__
Let him GO!__
*101388*__
[[S:::29432-31026]]__
RAHHHH!!!__
*101389*__
[[S:::41267-41983]]__
Father…__
*101390*__
[[S::vo_lvl_fthl01_s187_010_kra_stem:23459-25593]]__
AAAAARRGH!__
*101391*__
[[S:::59303-60962]]__
Ready yourself.__
*101392*__
[[S::vo_lvl_fthl01_s190_010_kra_stem:3110-4110]]__
Stay back, boy.__
*101393*__
[[S:::8570-9930]]__
We must find another way up.__
*101394*__
[[S:::26760-27890]]__
Why wait to warn us?__
*101395*__
[[S:::33280-33975]]__
Mm.__
*101396*__
[[S:::55720-56220]]__
Why help us?__
*101397*__
[[S:::82135-83229]]__
Where must we go?__
*101398*__
[[S:::89318-90037]]__
Rrrrn.__
*101399*__
[[S::vo_lvl_fthl01_s190_010_son_stem:4403-6956]]__
Ugh…. what IS that?__
*101400*__
[[S:::11264-15511]]__
The Witch. Wish she was here. I bet she could get us past this.__
*101401*__
[[S:::22609-23600]]__
What are you doing here?__
*101402*__
[[S:::49666-50447]]__
It’s everything.__
*101403*__
[[S:::73708-75006]]__
Even though we shot your friend?__
*101404*__
[[S::vo_lvl_fthl01_s190_010_fre_stem:16070-19860]]__
My magic is useless against the Black Breath, and there’s no way around it.__
*101405*__
[[S:::20360-22090]]__
Odin saw to that long ago.__
*101406*__
[[S:::23710-25650]]__
Making sure you can finish your journey.__
*101407*__
[[S:::28410-31630]]__
I was busy saving my friend, if you remember…__
*101408*__
[[S:::34510-39033]]__
The Black Breath is a corruption of magic even I can’t dispel.__
*101409*__
[[S:::39493-43202]]__
Only the pure Light of Alfheim is strong enough to break through it.__
*101410*__
[[S:::44236-45436]]__
But that road is long.__
*101411*__
[[S:::46194-47765]]__
What does this goal mean to you?__
*101412*__
[[S:::53103-53716]]__
Follow me.__
*101413*__
[[S:::59552-63713]]__
Maybe I see more of myself in you than I’m willing to admit. Maybe…__
*101414*__
[[S:::66177-68642]]__
maybe by helping you, I’ll make up for a lifetime of mistakes.__
*101415*__
[[S:::71330-72763]]__
Or maybe I just like you.__
*101416*__
[[S:::76634-78882]]__
Even though you shot my friend, yes.__
*101417*__
[[S:::85193-87444]]__
To a realm beyond your own…__
*101418*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_fthl01_s012_010_sin:79-2173]]__
Awww! I just cleaned that!__
*101419*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s015_010_son:0-2250]]__
You think all Dwarves are as weird as Brok and Sindri?__
*101420*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s015_020_kra:0-515]]__
No.__
*101421*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s015_030_son:114-3184]]__
Wonder why they don’t get along anymore. I mean, they’re family…__
*101422*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s015_040_kra:230-1750]]__
That is their matter alone, boy.__
*101423*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s015_050_son:11-406]]__
Okay.__
*101424*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_fthl01_s020_010_sin:0-2593]]__
Please be careful! I’m still fixing that!__
*101425*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_fthl01_s020_020_sin:20-1300]]__
Stupid head sheave.__

Tell me what’s wrong with you!__
*101427*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s025_010_son:54-2431]]__
I can’t tell… Are we getting closer to the mountain?__
*101428*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s025_020_kra:70-600]]__
We are.__
*101429*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s026_010_son:163-1042]]__

This place really is cursed.__
*101431*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s030_080_kra:0-500]]__
There.__
*101432*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s030_090_son:60-2359]]__
She really didn’t want anyone to open that, huh?__
*101433*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s030_100_son:90-1680]]__
But why let a deadly curse stop you?__
*101434*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s032_010_kra:0-960]]__
Above the entrance…__
*101435*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s032_020_son:80-2250]]__
It’s a warning. You sure this is the way?__
*101436*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s032_030_kra:50-750]]__
I am sure.__
*101437*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s035_010_son:0-2230]]__
Do you think for this last leg up the mountain that__
*101438*__
[[S:::2750-3940]]__
maybe I can carry her?__
*101439*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s035_020_kra:30-1000]]__
I told you, no.__
*101440*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s035_030_son:0-500]]__
Why?__
*101441*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s035_040_son:70-1500]]__
She meant more to me than you anyway.__
*101442*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s035_050_kra:25-349]]__
What?__
*101443*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s035_060_son:70-860]]__
I just meant…__
*101444*__
[[S:::1380-3970]]__
I spent more time with her. You were off hunting a lot.__
*101445*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s035_070_kra:40-2000]]__
It would serve you to stop talking.__
*101446*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s037_010_son:120-923]]__
An Ogre?!__
*101447*__
[[S:::1346-1868]]__
Here?__
*101448*__
[[S:::2300-3294]]__
Who built this place?__
*101449*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s040_010_son:90-760]]__
Whoa…__
*101450*__
[[S:::1150-3000]]__
I can see why mom wanted us to bring her here.__
*101451*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s040_020_kra:80-650]]__
Indeed.__
*101452*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s045_010_son:100-3250]]__
Wonder if Sindri knows his “Sky Mover” is tangled with roots up here?__
*101453*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s045_020_kra:61-881]]__
I doubt it.__
*101454*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s045_030_son:55-1399]]__
So how’s he going to get it to work?__
*101455*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s045_040_kra:9-1120]]__
I do not care.__
*101456*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s050_010_son:91-1207]]__
Is that… smoke?__
*101457*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s060_010_son:119-2349]]__
We’re going to another realm?! Are you coming with us?__
*101458*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s060_020_kra:0-1250]]__
Only for a little while.__
*101459*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s060_030_fre:0-1500]]__
Only for a little while.__
*101460*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s080_010_fre:0-1080]]__
We’ll use this.__
*101461*__
[[S:::2490-3550]]__
Greiða!__
*101462*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s080_020_son:70-1420]]__
Can’t. Sindri said it was broken.__
*101463*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s080_030_fre:10-586]]__
Sindri?__
*101464*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s080_040_kra:67-1856]]__
The Dwarf at the foot of these hills.__
*101465*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s080_050_son:53-1474]]__
He was fixing it when we got here.__
*101466*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s080_060_fre:0-2980]]__
No one was there when I passed by. Perhaps he finished?__
*101467*__
[[S:::3610-5250]]__
Dwarves are awfully resourceful.__
*101468*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s080_070_kra:90-2750]]__
And irritating, based on the two we have met.__
*101469*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s080_080_fre:1250-1750]]__
That too.__
*101470*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s090_010_fre:40-1000]]__
Just give that a turn.__
*101471*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s090_020_fre:0-1000]]__
There. See?__
*101472*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s100_010_fre:0-2170]]__
Týr’s Temple is at the center of the lake.__
*101473*__
[[S:::2900-5050]]__
It is from there we travel to Alfheim.__
*101474*__
[[S:::5580-7500]]__
Thankfully, it’s no longer under water.__
*101475*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s100_020_kra:40-1500]]__
Why is that creature in the bay?__
*101476*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s100_030_fre:0-840]]__
No one knows.__
*101477*__
[[S:::1440-2920]]__
He just appeared one day.__
*101478*__
[[S:::3670-9250]]__
Soon after, Thor attacked and their battle could be felt across all the realms.__
*101479*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s100_040_fre:0-1920]]__
Ultimately, it ended in a stalemate__
*101480*__
[[S:::2270-4540]]__
and Thor returned to Odin empty-handed.__
*101481*__
[[S:::5280-10250]]__
The Serpent stayed and grew so large he now spans all of Midgard.__
*101482*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s100_050_son:60-1250]]__
See! Told you…__
*101483*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s100_060_fre:0-1490]]__
They’ve hated each other ever since…__
*101484*__
[[S:::2060-4250]]__
destined to kill each other come Ragnarök.__
*101485*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s100_070_son:80-1250]]__
You believe in Ragnarök?__
*101486*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s100_080_fre:5-1534]]__
I dearly wish I didn’t, child.__
*101487*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s110_010_son:0-500]]__
You know…__
*101488*__
[[S:::870-2500]]__
we actually talked to the World Serpent.__
*101489*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s110_020_fre:2-724]]__
You did?__
*101490*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s110_030_kra:33-1069]]__
An exaggeration.__
*101491*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s110_040_son:157-3101]]__
I’m good with languages… even ones I’ve never heard before.__
*101492*__
[[S:::3393-5912]]__
But when he talks, I can’t understand any of it!__
*101493*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s110_050_fre:25-1250]]__
Sadly, no one can.__
*101494*__
[[S:::1620-3060]]__
He speaks a dead tongue.__
*101495*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s110_060_son:39-375]]__
Oh.__
*101496*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s110_070_son:50-794]]__
Must be lonely.__
*101497*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl01_s180_010_son_stem:6650-7460]]__
It reads:__
*101498*__
[[S:::7960-10740]]__
“Sacrifice your arms to the center of the water;__
*101499*__
[[S:::11630-13400]]__
awaken again the cradle of the world.”__
*101500*__
[[S:::14760-15700]]__
What...__
*101501*__
[[S:::16370-18060]]__
throw our weapons into the water?__
*101502*__
[[S:::19140-20410]]__
Guess that won’t be a problem for you.__
*101503*__
[[S:::23074-24620]]__
Are you gonna do it?__
*101504*__
[[S:::57280-58260]]__
Okay!__
*101505*__
[[S:::77770-79390]]__
It’s the World Serpent…__
*101506*__
[[S:::97660-99870]]__
I am! This is great…!__
*101507*__
[[S:::110620-112800]]__
Yeah! Mom said he’s friendly!__
*101508*__
[[S:::114310-115500]]__
I don’t know!__
*101509*__
[[S:::127690-130500]]__
That… that was amazing…__
*101510*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl01_s180_010_kra_stem:31552-33168]]__
Mmm…__
*101511*__
[[S:::41110-42950]]__
The axe did not return…__
*101512*__
[[S:::55870-56630]]__
Hang on, boy!__
*101513*__
[[S:::68110-68830]]__
What__
*101514*__
[[S:::69230-70190]]__
is this?__
*101515*__
[[S:::95670-96870]]__
Stay calm, boy!__
*101516*__
[[S:::108980-110171]]__
It speaks?!__
*101517*__
[[S:::112700-114226]]__
What is it saying?__
*101518*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl01_s181_010_son_stem:3880-6600]]__
Wait... there’s a shipwreck way over there. See that?__
*101519*__
[[S:::7950-11500]]__
And there’s the statue of Thor. Except... I can see a lot more of him now.__
*101520*__
[[S:::15900-19000]]__
Ooooh... that must be why that beach wasn’t there before. See?__
*101521*__
[[S:::20500-25200]]__
And there’s the mountain! Lookit—that building leads from the foot of the mountain to that golden temple.__
*101522*__
[[S:::29200-34200]]__
Except for the statue. Good thing, huh? There’s even a dock—there, next to the flag.__
*101523*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl01_s181_010_kra_stem:12180-15220]]__
The water dropped—when the serpent rose.__
*101524*__
[[S:::26780-28250]]__
It was all just under the surface.__
*101525*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl01_s182_010_son_stem:2106-3280]]__
Is this the way to the mountain?__
*101526*__
[[S:::11860-12372]]__
Brok?__
*101527*__
[[S:::14100-14988]]__
But how did you—__
*101528*__
[[S:::24056-25178]]__
Okay…__
*101529*__
[[S:::29544-30907]]__
What do you think he wants?__
*101530*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl01_s182_010_kra_stem:4021-5112]]__
It would seem.__
*101531*__
[[S:::31069-32970]]__
To test our patience.__
*101532*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl01_s182_010_brk_stem:5481-11002]]__
If it isn’t the bearded beefer and his sac-seed! Have I got something for you two...__
*101533*__
[[S:::15301-23247]]__
None of yer fuckin' business. Now get in here, I got something for ya! And don't go makin' pig eyes at my spot... I saw it first!__
*101534*__
[[S:::32968-37681]]__
When word gets out about my new shop, folks’ll finally come outta hiding.__
*101535*__
[[S:::37868-42866]]__
They’ll be clawing all over each other just to catch a whiff of my wares— you watch!__
*101536*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s005_010_son:29-1543]]__
Now we’ll get to the mountain quick.__
*101537*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s005_020_son:134-3194]]__
I just can’t believe I’m here, doing all this.__
*101538*__
[[S:::3590-5763]]__
There was a time I thought I’d never leave our woods.__
*101539*__
[[S:::6193-7756]]__
Or even my own bed sometimes.__
*101540*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s005_030_kra:140-1898]]__
You were not to blame for your sickness.__
*101541*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s005_040_son:0-680]]__
Oh, I know.__
*101542*__
[[S:::1210-2200]]__
I guess I’m just saying…__
*101543*__
[[S:::2780-3500]]__
this is great.__
*101544*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s008_010_son:85-2463]]__
There’s the mountain! Look how close we are.__
*101545*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s008_020_kra:0-1450]]__
We flow into sea water.__
*101546*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s008_030_son:0-580]]__
How do you know?__
*101547*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s008_040_kra:0-1000]]__
Do you not smell it?__
*101548*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s008_050_son:0-1340]]__
If that smell is the sea,__
*101549*__
[[S:::3110-4000]]__
the sea stinks.__
*101550*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s010_010_son:36-1800]]__
Look at that. It’s Thor…__
*101551*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s010_011_son:0-1500]]__
… and a lot of water.__
*101552*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s010_040_kra:30-1250]]__
You have never seen so much.__
*101553*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s010_050_son:24-461]]__
Never.__
*101554*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s015_010_son:11-1824]]__
Look at that. It’s Thor…__
*101555*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s015_020_kra:40-640]]__
Thor…__
*101556*__
[[S:::1460-2460]]__
God of Thunder…__
*101557*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s015_030_son:33-3700]]__
That’s right! I never thought you listened when mother spoke of the gods.__
*101558*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s015_040_kra:30-1210]]__
I seldom did.__
*101559*__
[[S:::1910-3750]]__
Did she speak of one who could feel no pain?__
*101560*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s015_050_son:100-500]]__
Oh—__
*101561*__
[[S:::1690-2750]]__
that sounds like Baldur.__
*101562*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s015_060_kra:0-500]]__
Baldur…__
*101563*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s015_070_son:60-850]]__
An Aesir god.__
*101564*__
[[S:::1210-2250]]__
Son of Odin and Frigg.__
*101565*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s015_080_kra:24-1605]]__
And Odin is king…__
*101566*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s015_090_son:14-2520]]__
That’s right. Why do you ask?__
*101567*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s020_010_son:0-1640]]__
I think I see something…__
*101568*__
[[S:::2180-3500]]__
just sitting there in the middle of the lake.__
*101569*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s020_020_son:34-460]]__
OH.__
*101570*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s020_031_son:0-1000]]__
It’s some kind of statue.__
*101571*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s020_040_son:30-2250]]__
I see runes there, on his chest.__
*101572*__
[[S:::3010-4250]]__
Can’t quite make it out.__
*101573*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s020_050_son:0-1750]]__
Maybe if we got closer to the statue?__
*101574*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s030_010_son:64-5223]]__
We’re going to the dock first, right? We’ll be the first people to walk on it in who knows how long!__
*101575*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s030_020_kra:0-1250]]__
You know of that serpent?__
*101576*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s030_030_son:0-1020]]__
He’s one of the Giants—__
*101577*__
[[S:::1440-5243]]__
and he’s so big he’s wrapped around the whole world and bites his own tail.__
*101578*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s030_040_kra:0-1000]]__
An exaggeration.__
*101579*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s030_050_son:20-560]]__
I dunno…__
*101580*__
[[S:::950-2100]]__
looked pretty big to me.__
*101581*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s035_010_son:20-691]]__
Oh, good.__
*101582*__
[[S:::1300-2860]]__
I was hoping we might explore a little.__
*101583*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s035_020_kra:60-1930]]__
When we wish to continue our journey,__
*101584*__
[[S:::2340-3470]]__
we know to return here.__
*101585*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s032_010_son:24-1318]]__
How long you think this has been here?__
*101586*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s032_020_kra:0-1250]]__
A very long time…__
*101587*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl01_s033_010_brk:0-2500]]__
You rush around like that everywhere? Yeesh.__
*101588*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl01_s033_020_brk:19-3207]]__
C’mere already! You’re gonna be real happy.__
*101589*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s033_030_son:0-600]]__
Wait—__
*101590*__
[[S:::860-1870]]__
aren’t we talking to Brok?__
*101591*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s033_080_son:0-1598]]__
Yeah, I don’t see us wanting that.__
*101592*__

Good! You want a job?__
*101593*__
[[S:::2400-5140]]__
When you’re done gawkin’, I got a job for you.__
*101594*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl01_s033_010_brk_stem:620-1390]]__
Catch!__
*101595*__
[[S:::2990-4470]]__
The pile of rocks there—__
*101596*__
[[S:::5130-10950]]__
with that Key of Yggdrasil, you can open a magic door to the branches of the World Tree—__
*101597*__
[[S:::11330-13520]]__
a shortcut ‘tween the realms.__
*101598*__
[[S:::14068-18754]]__
If y’ever see ‘em out in the world, use it to get back to me quick.__
*101599*__
[[S:::19119-20901]]__
But it’s only one-way—__
*101600*__
[[S:::21201-23489]]__
straight back here and nowhere else.__
*101601*__
[[S:::23579-34540]]__
And whatever you do, never, never, EVER, never, ever, throw yourself over the edge of the path... lest you want death.__
*101602*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s034_050_son:0-1500]]__
You sure you don’t want to see what he’s got in there?__
*101603*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s034_060_kra:70-2840]]__
Following the Dwarf will not get us closer to the mountain.__
*101604*__
[[S:::3840-5144]]__
That tower looks like it will.__
*101605*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s034_070_son:0-1500]]__
I guess it is in the right direction…__
*101606*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s036_010_son:0-2029]]__
Looks like the same person as the big statue.__
*101607*__
[[S:::2490-3310]]__
Must be a god.__
*101608*__
[[S:::3800-4435]]__
Or a king?__
*101609*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s045_010_son:160-860]]__
Soooo…__
*101610*__
[[S:::1600-3570]]__
we can either keep heading towards the mountain__
*101611*__
[[S:::4120-6110]]__
or break off and do that favor for Brok.__
*101612*__
[[S:::7110-7870]]__
What do you wanna do?__
*101613*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s045_020_kra:0-1000]]__
What do you think?__
*101614*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s045_030_son:180-550]]__
Well,__
*101615*__
[[S:::1030-2320]]__
the mountain will always be there.__
*101616*__
[[S:::2790-3260]]__
And__
*101617*__
[[S:::3620-6000]]__
I think mother would want me to see more of the world.__
*101618*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s045_040_kra:0-2750]]__
Or she would want us to fulfill our promise right away.__
*101619*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s045_050_son:0-369]]__
Mother?__
*101620*__
[[S:::980-1190]]__
Naaaah…__
*101621*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s055_010_son:25-3677]]__
We’re back in the boat. So I guess we are helping Brok?__
*101622*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s055_020_kra:50-2680]]__
When the water dropped, new beaches were exposed.__
*101623*__
[[S:::3180-4750]]__
We should search them for resources.__
*101624*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s055_030_son:0-500]]__
Oh.__
*101625*__
[[S:::850-1620]]__
That sounds good too!__
*101626*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_011_son:38-1077]]__
What is this?__
*101627*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_012_kra:0-810]]__
A horn.__
*101628*__
[[S:::1600-2360]]__
Here is the end.__
*101629*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_013_son:0-830]]__
Can we blow into it?__
*101630*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_014_kra:0-1250]]__
Without knowing the outcome?__
*101631*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_015_son:40-2750]]__
Well, we usually push every button and pull every lever we see!__
*101632*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_016_kra:0-1400]]__
Outcomes we can predict.__
*101633*__
[[S:::1950-2450]]__
No,__
*101634*__
[[S:::2970-4110]]__
this is something else.__
*101635*__
[[S:::5050-6750]]__
We must develop your instincts.__
*101636*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_070_son:40-750]]__
I knew it!__
*101637*__
[[S:::1110-2250]]__
We are blowing the horn…__
*101638*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_080_kra:0-500]]__
No.__
*101639*__
[[S:::1200-2834]]__
We are testing your resolve.__
*101640*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_090_son:0-860]]__
I have resolve.__
*101641*__
[[S:::1690-2460]]__
A bunch of it.__
*101642*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_100_son:0-1810]]__
I won’t blow into it if you don’t.__
*101643*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_110_mmr:0-3359]]__
I don’t think we should disturb Jörmungandr without some reason…__
*101644*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_120_mmr:0-2000]]__
There’s really no call for that at this point.__
*101645*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_130_mmr:0-3250]]__
The snake’s already in position, brother—nothing more to negotiate.__
*101646*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_140_mmr:0-4750]]__
He’s already agreed to let us look for my eye in his belly. Best get it over with.__
*101647*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_150_mmr:0-2500]]__
I think we’re better off letting the snake rest, brother.__
*101648*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_160_son:0-1690]]__
Yeah, you’re probably right.__
*101649*__

[[S:::990-2750]]__
that tower leads through to the mountain.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s065_020_son:2-466]]__
I’m ready.__
*101653*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s075_010_son:0-750]]__
Just another boat.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s078_001_son:2-670]]__
Uh…__
*101655*__
[[S:::1350-2097]]__
okay,__
*101656*__
[[S:::2919-3606]]__
what is that?__
*101657*__
[[S:::4644-5442]]__
Is that a wall?__
*101658*__
[[S:::6053-7015]]__
Made out of…__
*101659*__
[[S:::8067-8973]]__
what are those?__
*101660*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s078_002_kra:4-649]]__
Scales.__
*101661*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s078_003_son:0-820]]__
Scales?__
*101662*__
[[S:::1460-2750]]__
Why do they look like scales?__
*101663*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s078_004_son:7-774]]__
Don’t answer that.__
*101664*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s078_010_son:37-3151]]__
The World Serpent’s even over here! I told you he’s big.__
*101665*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s078_020_son:88-3097]]__
I wonder if the World Serpent even knows part of his body’s laying over here.__
*101666*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s085_010_son:13-681]]__
Ohhh…__
*101667*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s090_010_son:40-1040]]__
What is that?__
*101668*__
[[S:::1420-2250]]__
Smells awful…__
*101669*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s090_020_kra:25-786]]__
Poison…__

Stay alert.__
*101673*__
[[S:::1500-2250]]__
She is close.__
*101674*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s110_010_son:950-2200]]__
What were those things?__
*101675*__
[[S:::2590-3620]]__
They smelled awful.__
*101676*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s110_020_kra:40-1940]]__
Your mother called them “scorn poles.”__
*101677*__
[[S:::2560-3510]]__
Poison magic.__
*101678*__
[[S:::4160-6430]]__
She was the one who showed me how to disable them.__

What?__
*101681*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s110_050_son:17-2294]]__
It’s just funny to think of her teaching you something.__

Yes.__

[[S:::20160-21070]]__
Think you can… spot…__

[[S:::22860-23380]]__
The light.__

[[S:::24200-25060]]__
I can barely see it.__

[[S:::26010-26780]]__
Something’s wrong.__

[[S:::27280-29410]]__
See that column of light on the horizon?__
*101689*__
[[S:::29850-31580]]__
It’s housed in the heart of a ringed temple.__
*101690*__
[[S:::32040-33352]]__
We’ll find what we need there.__
*101691*__
[[S:::34113-38000]]__
No, no, no, no, no. Dammit, not yet…__
*101692*__
[[S:::41172-46407]]__
To restore the Bifröst’s magic, you must step into The Light. But be very careful not to get caught up in the—__
*101693*__
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s210_010_son_stem:38001-38490]]__
What’s happening—?!__

No!__

Hrrn.__
*101697*__
[[S:::58098-59263]]__
Not likely.__

[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s220_010_son_stem:155-1834]]__
AARGH! OWW!__

[[S:::5273-7645]]__
Voices. You don’t hear that?__
*101701*__
[[S:::11350-12508]]__
It’s going away now.__
*101702*__
[[S:::13119-14110]]__
There was screaming.__

[[S:::15053-16501]]__
Lots of voices... Angry.__

[[S:::18885-20839]]__
You really didn’t hear that?__

[[S:::24670-27956]]__
It felt... evil.__

[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s220_010_kra_stem:1950-2640]]__
What is it, boy?__
*101707*__
[[S:::8160-8800]]__
I hear nothing.__

No.__

[[S:::5150-5770]]__
I have him.__

[[S:::6410-7160]]__
Your knife boy!__
*101718*__
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s236_010_son_stem:1530-2420]]__
Another one!__

[[S:::18010-18510]]__
The light…__

[[S:::25270-25740]]__
Got it.__

[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s236_010_kra_stem:2370-3000]]__
Stay back!__

[[S:::18240-18855]]__
Shhh!__

Stay behind me and protect our flank!__

Right!__

[[S:::15877-16950]]__
Yes, sir!__

[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s240a_010_kra_stem:5797-6835]]__
Boy!__

[[S:::22815-24514]]__
Are you injured?__

[[S:::73423-74857]]__
Stay here.__

[[S:::75516-76746]]__
Stay.__
*101734*__
[[S:::77145-78372]]__
Here.__
*101735*__
[[S:::83227-86368]]__
Only use it as a last resort.__
*101736*__
[[S:::90025-92646]]__
I am letting you hold my axe.__
*101737*__
[[S:::94483-96253]]__
It is not a gift.__
*101738*__
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s240a_010_son_stem:24110-25682]]__
I’m fine.__
*101739*__
[[S:::27320-28679]]__
Wow…__

[[S:::28899-30008]]__
It’s beautiful…__
*101741*__
[[S:::37534-41308]]__
The light… it’s making the whole temple reappear.__
*101742*__
[[S:::41542-43125]]__
It’s the source of all of it.__
*101743*__
[[S:::46999-50896]]__
Wait—it’s… it’s singing.__
*101744*__
[[S:::51630-57274]]__
I hear…I hear her. I told you I heard her! Do you think she’s in there?__

[[S:::58457-61043]]__
Aah! Aah…__
*101746*__
[[S:::62298-66455]]__
That really hurt. Felt like my hand was on fire.__
*101747*__
[[S:::75094-76494]]__
But I want to go—__
*101748*__
[[S:::88704-91109]]__
You’re giving me your axe?__

[[S:::97134-98272]]__
Still…__

[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s240b_010_kra_stem:12880-13750]]__

[[S:::9225-10890]]__
NO!!!...NO!__

[[S:::11357-12519]]__
What have you done?__

[[S:::12801-14087]]__
Why did you do that?__
*101758*__
[[S:::20953-21965]]__
Boy...__
*101759*__
[[S:::22483-23974]]__
I was gone only...__
*101760*__
[[S:::29240-30363]]__
moments…__

[[S:::43390-44440]]__
I…__

[[S:::46201-47730]]__
That’s impossible.__

Yes.__
*101764*__
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s242_010_son_stem:14324-21007]]__
I saved you! You were trapped in there. I waited and I waited but you wouldn’t come out… So I pulled you out!__

[[S:::30525-36077]]__
NO. You’ve been gone a long, long time!__
*101766*__
[[S:::36844-43162]]__
I didn’t know what to do. You left me here. AGAIN. Why don’t you care?__
*101767*__
[[S:::51756-53542]]__
We should go before they come back.__
*101768*__
[[S:::55019-56989]]__
I hope you got what you needed.__

[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s243_010_kra_stem:890-1430]]__
Boy…__
*101770*__
[[S:::1840-2440]]__
your bow.__

[[S:::5050-5750]]__
Hold it out.__

[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s247_010_son_stem:9581-10220]]__
No.__

That can’t be.__

[[S:::13139-15284]]__
That we made a “grave mistake.”__
*101775*__
[[S:::19299-20667]]__
Did we help the wrong side?__
*101776*__
[[S:::21831-23062]]__
Let me guess…__
*101777*__
[[S:::23085-25754]]__
you’re gonna be smug and say you told me we shouldn’t get involved.__
*101778*__
[[S:::27442-28513]]__
Can we go now?__
*101779*__
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s247_010_kra_stem:11750-12756]]__
What did it say?__
*101780*__
[[S:::20820-21408]]__
I—__
*101781*__
[[S:::26230-26790]]__
That is enough!__
*101782*__
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s250a_010_son_stem:1309-1902]]__
So…__
*101783*__
[[S:::4134-4854]]__
Was she in the light?__
*101784*__
[[S:::7668-8328]]__
You know.__
*101785*__
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s250a_010_kra_stem:6300-6810]]__
Who.__
*101786*__
[[S:::10530-11030]]__
No.__
*101787*__
[[S:::11510-12250]]__
She was not there.__
*101788*__
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s250_010_son_stem:1862-4027]]__
Not like you would even care if she was…__
*101789*__
[[S:::24386-25363]]__
I’m sorry…__
*101790*__
[[S:::27302-28446]]__
I didn’t realize...__
*101791*__
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s250_010_kra_stem:3981-5650]]__
Mind your tongue, boy!__
*101792*__
[[S:::6460-10073]]__
Until our journey is over, one of us must remain focused.__
*101793*__
[[S:::10700-13630]]__
Do not mistake my silence for lack of grief!__
*101794*__
[[S:::15340-16590]]__
Mourn how you wish,__
*101795*__
[[S:::17450-19258]]__
leave me to my own.__
*101796*__
[[S:::29510-30321]]__
No...__
*101797*__
[[S:::31150-32324]]__
Why would you?__
*101798*__
[[S:::33970-35574]]__
You do not know my ways.__
*101799*__
[[S:::38264-40207]]__
I know it has not been easy.__
*101800*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s250a_010_son:0-580]]__
So…__
*101801*__
[[S:::1100-1750]]__
Was she in the light?__
*101802*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s250a_020_kra:54-548]]__
Who.__
*101803*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s250a_030_son:0-500]]__
You know.__
*101804*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s250a_040_kra:0-500]]__
No.__
*101805*__
[[S:::930-1750]]__
She was not there.__
*101806*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s015_010_son:100-1000]]__
Look at this place…__
*101807*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s015_020_kra:20-1050]]__
Stay by me,__
*101808*__
[[S:::1480-2250]]__
touch nothing.__
*101809*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s015_030_son:90-1290]]__
She’s probably not coming back,__
*101810*__
[[S:::1820-2350]]__
is she?__
*101811*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s015_040_son:30-2390]]__
The Witch told us to head for that giant light shaft out there.__
*101812*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s030_010_son:50-810]]__
Okay—__
*101813*__
[[S:::1260-1880]]__
what is that?__
*101814*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s030_020_son:12-1123]]__
That stuff’s strong…__
*101815*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s030_030_son:49-1742]]__
Is there something glowing inside that knot?__
*101816*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s030_040_son:250-1380]]__
I think you killed it.__
*101817*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s030_050_son:0-2500]]__
Another one… and look! A Light Elf on that ridge!__
*101818*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s050_010_son:0-480]]__
Whoa…__
*101819*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s050_020_son:41-787]]__
What’s that about?__
*101820*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s050_030_kra:70-2500]]__
Not our concern, boy. Focus.__
*101821*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s055_010_son:70-2000]]__
What are they attacking us for? We didn’t do anything.__
*101822*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s055_020_kra:125-2036]]__
Hmph. More will come.__
*101823*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s060_020_son:17-649]]__
What’re you doing?__
*101824*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s060_030_son:0-1080]]__
Oh—a coffin!__
*101825*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s070_010_son:32-803]]__
Did you say something?__
*101826*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s070_020_kra:0-550]]__
No.__
*101827*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s070_030_son:29-833]]__
Oh. Okay.__
*101828*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s070_040_son:105-3657]]__
Anyway… I can’t believe we’re here. This all feels like a dream.__
*101829*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s075_010_kra:0-750]]__
Can you read this?__
*101830*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s075_020_son:42-3513]]__
Hm… something about an “eternal war for the light.”__
*101831*__
[[S:::3964-7700]]__
I don’t get it—if both sides need it, why not just share it?__
*101832*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s075_030_kra:0-670]]__
Greed.__
*101833*__
[[S:::1190-3600]]__
You will find it a common cause for war.__
*101834*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s075_040_kra:0-922]]__
What does it say?__
*101835*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s075_050_son:16-4889]]__
It’s about the “eternal war for the light.” Do you think it’ll stop now after what we did?__
*101836*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s075_060_kra:13-813]]__
Unlikely.__
*101837*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_alf01_s425_010_sin:40-600]]__
You’re back!__
*101838*__
[[S:::1130-2000]]__
I see you’ve been busy.__
*101839*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s425_020_kra:0-1000]]__
How observant.__
*101840*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_alf01_s425_030_sin:0-2410]]__
I am known for my attention to detail.__
*101841*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_alf01_s425_040_sin:0-270]]__
No?!__
*101842*__
[[S:::890-1250]]__
Okay!…__
*101843*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_alf01_s425_050_sin:0-650]]__
Not like I’__
*101844*__
[[S:::1160-1410]]__
m the best craftsman you’ll ever know or anything…__
*101845*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s080_010_son:114-2695]]__
Ugh… Where’s this stuff even come from?__
*101846*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s080_020_son:50-1460]]__
Uh… wait…__
*101847*__
[[S:::2020-2850]]__
so…__
*101848*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s080_030_son:0-1190]]__
You’re really close…__
*101849*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s080_040_son:75-591]]__
Yeah!__
*101850*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s090_010_son:0-750]]__
Another dead one.__
*101851*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s091_010_son:60-1767]]__
At least we’re getting closer to the light.__
*101852*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s100_010_son:50-1825]]__
Look— there’s a boat tangled up over there.__
*101853*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s100_011_son:83-1228]]__
Wait… is that Sindri?__
*101854*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s100_020_son:33-723]]__
Boat’s free!__
*101855*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s120_010_son:53-662]]__
What’d you say?__
*101856*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s120_020_kra:70-1123]]__
I said nothing.__
*101857*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s120_030_son:0-560]]__
Really?__
*101858*__
[[S:::1110-1750]]__
Okay…__
*101859*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s125_010_kra:180-1750]]__
Did your mother speak of this realm?__
*101860*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s125_020_son:0-660]]__
Not much.__
*101861*__
[[S:::2090-4210]]__
Just that since the Elves were always fighting over the Light,__
*101862*__
[[S:::5350-6250]]__
it kept them isolated.__
*101863*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s111_020_son:22-345]]__
Huh?__
*101864*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s111_020_kra:80-590]]__
Again,__
*101865*__
[[S:::1070-1750]]__
I said nothing.__
*101866*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s111_030_son:33-1813]]__
Weird. Could have sworn you said some—__
*101867*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s110_010_son:84-1917]]__
Look. Should we try talking to them?__
*101868*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s110_020_kra:30-250]]__
No.__
*101869*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s110_030_son:64-1043]]__
But maybe they need help.__
*101870*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s110_040_kra:110-3000]]__
They do not stop us, so they do not concern us.__
*101871*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s110_050_son:60-1050]]__
But maybe—__
*101872*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s110_060_kra:40-1750]]__
They do not concern us.__
*101873*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s130_010_son:40-2865]]__
Look at that… that must be the ringed temple.__
*101874*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s135_010_son:210-2049]]__
Look, they have Sand Bowls in Alfheim too!__
*101875*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s135_020_son:0-500]]__
Should I read it?__
*101876*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s135_030_kra:30-750]]__
What does it ask?__
*101877*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s135_040_son:0-2990]]__
“Without me or within me death is sure /__
*101878*__
[[S:::3370-6310]]__
Yet within you I am life most pure.”__
*101879*__
[[S:::7270-9250]]__
But… I don’t see any runes around here.__
*101880*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s135_050_kra:630-1530]]__
We must find it.__
*101881*__
[[S:::1930-2750]]__
Back to the boat.__
*101882*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s135_060_kra:0-750]]__
What does it ask?__
*101883*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s135_070_son:40-2990]]__
“Without me or within me death is sure /__
*101884*__
[[S:::3950-6870]]__
Yet within you I am life most pure.”__
*101885*__
[[S:::8580-10000]]__
Yep—it’s “water” all right.__
*101886*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s135_080_son:70-770]]__
I think you’re right.__
*101887*__
[[S:::1420-2300]]__
The runes aren’t here.__
*101888*__
[[S:::3260-4610]]__
Maybe we should head to the temple?__
*101889*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s138_010_son:50-1700]]__
They keep murdering the Light Elves.__
*101890*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s138_010_son_a:60-1750]]__
They keep murdering the Light Elves, what’s going on here?__
*101891*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s138_020_kra:40-760]]__
It is war…__
*101892*__
[[S:::1190-2020]]__
the end of one.__
*101893*__
[[S:::2720-3750]]__
The robed ones lost.__
*101894*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s138_030_son:25-398]]__
Oh.__
*101895*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s138_040_kra:30-750]]__
Be ready!__
*101896*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s138_040_kra_a:40-750]]__
Be ready!__
*101897*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s140_031_son:0-2399]]__
Father… I have a confession to make.__
*101898*__
[[S:::3080-5343]]__
All those voices in my head… well,__
*101899*__
[[S:::6210-7468]]__
this wasn’t the first time.__
*101900*__
[[S:::8131-9336]]__
Back when we met Brok...__
*101901*__
[[S:::9588-12259]]__
his animal warned me about something hiding in the trees.__
*101902*__
[[S:::12566-13897]]__
That’s why she didn’t want to cross.__
*101903*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s140_040_kra:90-930]]__
She told you?__
*101904*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s140_050_son:0-2120]]__
Well… I could just feel what she was feeling…__
*101905*__
[[S:::2550-3890]]__
what she was afraid of.__
*101906*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s140_060_kra:97-4159]]__
Mmm. It happens again, you tell me. Understand?__
*101907*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s140_070_son:0-500]]__
I promise.__
*101908*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s150_010_son:0-650]]__
Aaah!__
*101909*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s150_020_kra:65-560]]__
Boy!__
*101910*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s150_030_son:86-8072]]__
It was the voices again… but different voices. Less angry. They were asking for help.__
*101911*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s150_040_kra:0-3870]]__
We are here for the Light. I do not care who they are nor what they want.__
*101912*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s150_050_son:29-1313]]__
You never care about anything…__
*101913*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s150_060_kra:51-1308]]__
You have something to say?__
*101914*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s150_070_son:43-823]]__
No…__
*101915*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s160_010_son:49-3128]]__
The blue door—that’s gotta be the entrance. Let’s go!__
*101916*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s160_011_kra:30-750]]__
Careful, boy.__
*101917*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s160_020_son:52-830]]__
What are they doing?__
*101918*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s160_021_son:90-3525]]__
The bridge is gone. They covered the crystal with that stuff. Why?__
*101919*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s160_030_kra:50-1480]]__
To prevent reinforcements.__
*101920*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s170_010_son:46-1819]]__
Maybe we can fix the bridge from down there?__
*101921*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s175_010_son:0-1360]]__
What is their problem with us?__
*101922*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s175_020_kra:50-1250]]__
We do not belong here.__
*101923*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s180_010_son:0-1640]]__
Okay, so that did something…__
*101924*__
[[S:::2000-2500]]__
I think?__
*101925*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s180_020_son:50-3250]]__
Wait. Combined together like that… they kind of look like a rune.__
*101926*__
[[S:::3885-5476]]__
But it doesn’t make sense…__
*101927*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s180_030_kra:0-1500]]__
Come. Back to the sand bowl.__
*101928*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s180_040_kra:50-1250]]__
Come. Back to the boat.__
*101929*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s180_050_son:19-4908]]__
Hmm. Don’t see anything else over here. Maybe we should check the sand bowl again?__
*101930*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s190_010_son:70-2500]]__
Father? You ever know anyone else who heard voices?__
*101931*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s190_020_kra:120-2000]]__
I knew men at sea who went mad…__
*101932*__
[[S:::2480-4500]]__
claiming voices called to them from the reefs.__
*101933*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s190_030_son:0-1000]]__
How did you fix them?__
*101934*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s190_040_kra:40-1250]]__
We threw them overboard.__
*101935*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s195_010_son:60-560]]__
Father!__
*101936*__
[[S:::1190-3160]]__
The pillars and ring form an elvish rune!__
*101937*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s195_020_kra:50-820]]__
Do you know it?__
*101938*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s195_030_son:50-1100]]__
It means “water.”__
*101939*__
[[S:::1560-2530]]__
Right… “__
*101940*__
[[S:::3510-4830]]__
life most pure.”__
*101941*__
[[S:::5430-6450]]__
And you die without it.__
*101942*__
[[S:::7550-8150]]__
Clever.__
*101943*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s195_031_kra:40-750]]__
Do you know it?__
*101944*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s195_040_son:0-1490]]__
I’m pretty sure it means “water.”__
*101945*__
[[S:::1830-3610]]__
It’s gotta be tied to the sand bowl, right? __
*101946*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s195_041_kra:40-680]]__
Draw it.__
*101947*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s195_050_son:0-370]]__
Okay.__
*101948*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s196_010_son:30-800]]__
Lögr__
*101949*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s196_020_son:46-689]]__
What’s happening!?__
*101950*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s196_030_son:53-1712]]__
Woahhh… look what we found!__
*101951*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s230_010_son:0-480]]__
Father…__
*101952*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s230_020_kra:30-402]]__
Yes?__
*101953*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s230_030_son:220-1710]]__
The voices I heard, I…__
*101954*__
[[S:::2170-4490]]__
it was hard to make out… but way in the back__
*101955*__
[[S:::4960-6488]]__
I’m pretty sure I heard… mother.__
*101956*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s230_040_kra:0-1250]]__
That is not possible.__
*101957*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s230_050_son:50-1170]]__
But I know what I heard—__
*101958*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s230_060_kra:0-1400]]__
Atreus. Enough.__
*101959*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s197_010_son:0-2320]]__
He looks different. Look at those horns.__
*101960*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s197_020_kra:0-750]]__
Behind me, boy.__
*101961*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s197_030_son:48-951]]__
That can’t be good.__
*101962*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s198_010_kra:90-1500]]__
Stay away from those cages.__
*101963*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s198_020_son:90-1250]]__
Wonder why they’re locked up.__
*101964*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s199a_010_kra:60-750]]__
Be ready.__
*101965*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s199a_020_son:33-444]]__
What?__
*101966*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s199b_010_son:40-1513]]__
Hope that was worth it.__
*101967*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s200_010_son:50-1770]]__
Look… another Nornir chest.__
*101968*__
[[S:::2430-4000]]__
Let’s see… where are the seals?__
*101969*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s205_010_son:110-768]]__
Okay.__
*101970*__
[[S:::1610-2153]]__
Tricky…__
*101971*__
[[S:::2570-3590]]__
very tricky.__
*101972*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s206_010_son:70-2000]]__
Think that side hallway will get us to the temple?__
*101973*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s206_020_kra:0-980]]__
We will find out.__
*101974*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s240_010_son:50-1000]]__
You were wrong back there.__
*101975*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s240_020_kra:0-550]]__
Oh…?__
*101976*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s240_030_son:60-1700]]__
I know mother’s voice better than anyone.__
*101977*__
[[S:::2080-2580]]__
It was her.__
*101978*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s240_040_kra:30-3000]]__
She is gone, boy. Speak no more of this.__
*101979*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s240_050_son:21-730]]__
Fine.__
*101980*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s211a_010_son:70-2399]]__
Get off him!__
*101981*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s211a_020_son:95-1341]]__
We didn’t do anything!__
*101982*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s211a_030_son:83-1405]]__
Let go of me!__
*101983*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s211a_040_son:53-1158]]__
Father, NO!!!__
*101984*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s211b_010_son:0-789]]__
Stay back!__
*101985*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s211b_020_kra:127-1892]]__
Hold on, boy! Fight!__
*101986*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s211b_030_son:30-907]]__
Father, hurry!__
*101987*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s211b_040_son:64-954]]__
Get away from me!__
*101988*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s211b_050_son:45-1078]]__
What do you want with us?!?__
*101989*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s211b_060_son:81-1358]]__
Don’t come any closer!__
*101990*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s211c_010_son:146-2306]]__
Thanks.__
*101991*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s211c_020_kra:0-490]]__
Mm.__
*101992*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s212_010_son:90-1010]]__
No way across here.__
*101993*__
[[S:::1530-3500]]__
Too bad the Witch’s bowstring doesn’t work anymore.__
*101994*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s213_010_son:50-3090]]__
Look—the blue temple door. We’re almost there.__
*101995*__
[[S:::3850-6190]]__
But the bridge crystal’s still covered in that stuff…__
*101996*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s215_010_son:30-1824]]__
Hey, you sure the Witch is okay?__
*101997*__
[[S:::2226-3917]]__
I’d hate to think she died helping us.__
*101998*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s215_020_kra:50-1250]]__
She knew what she was doing.__
*101999*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s215_030_son:40-540]]__
Okay.__
*102000*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s216_010_son:810-1360]]__
Ugh! More of it.__
*102001*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s216_020_kra:160-2610]]__
If we cut enough away, the bridge above us should re-appear.__
*102002*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s216_030_son:18-764]]__
Riiight.__
*102003*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s216_040_kra:0-1250]]__
Expect resistance.__
*102004*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s216_050_son:13-510]]__
Right.__
*102005*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s217a_010_son:20-2162]]__
You’re freezing it first! Smart!__
*102006*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s217_010_son:0-1000]]__
Well, there it is…__
*102007*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s217_020_kra:0-1000]]__
Watch our backs, boy.__
*102008*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s218_010_son:39-2152]]__
That did it! We brought the main bridge back!__
*102009*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s218_020_kra:0-1250]]__
We must find a way up.__
*102010*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s220_010_son:52-474]]__
Huh…__
*102011*__
[[S:::684-4015]]__
guess the light makes more than bridges. Maybe this will spit us out on top.__
*102012*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s231_010_son:24-2056]]__
Look! The blue door! We made it.__
*102013*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s232_010_son:0-2750]]__
You know… I will never get used to walking on solid light.__
*102014*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s232_020_kra:80-740]]__
The door.__
*102015*__
[[S:::1180-2000]]__
There is no seam.__
*102016*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s232_030_son:22-408]]__
What?__
*102017*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s232_040_kra:60-1000]]__
We have a problem.__
*102018*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s235_010_kra:54-1745]]__
These doors do not open.__
*102019*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s235_020_son:15-563]]__
Hello?__
*102020*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s235_030_son:56-2081]]__
I don’t get it. Why even have a door then?__
*102021*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s235_040_son:82-1099]]__
Hellooo?__
*102022*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s235_050_kra:0-2190]]__
Come. We will find another way in.__
*102023*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s236_010_kra:20-1000]]__
More of those bells.__
*102024*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s236_020_son:40-1500]]__
A Nornir chest must be nearby.__
*102025*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s238_010_kra:24-1278]]__
The Dwarf again.__
*102026*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s238_020_son:69-606]]__
Sindri?__
*102027*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s245_010_kra:34-570]]__
This way.__
*102028*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s245_020_son:50-2500]]__
Hey… how did Sindri get ahead of us?__
*102029*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s245_030_kra:100-2250]]__
He and the blue one do seem to travel quickly.__
*102030*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s245_040_son:21-413]]__
Huh.__
*102031*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s250_010_son:36-754]]__
We’re inside.__
*102032*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s256_010_son:27-1108]]__
This place is great.__
*102033*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s256_020_son:36-884]]__
OF course.__
*102034*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s260_010_son:60-3000]]__
I bet it was beautiful here before the Dark Elves destroyed everything.__
*102035*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s262_010_son:46-1396]]__
Wonder what those are attached to.__
*102036*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s262_020_son:34-775]]__
Almost!__
*102037*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s262_030_son:0-800]]__
Nice.__
*102038*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s263_010_son:0-790]]__
Whoa.__
*102039*__
[[S:::1150-2500]]__
Now that’s impressive.__
*102040*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s264_010_son:0-1390]]__
“From darkness…__
*102041*__
[[S:::1800-2910]]__
keep safe the light.”__
*102042*__
[[S:::3980-6215]]__
Didn’t do a very good job, did they?__
*102043*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s265_010_kra:40-1273]]__
There. The light.__
*102044*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s265_020_son:40-3500]]__
They’ve covered it up with that stuff... why would they do that?__
*102045*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s270_010_son:80-580]]__
Look…__
*102046*__
[[S:::1420-2250]]__
another Light Elf.__
*102047*__
[[S:::3020-3583]]__
What’s he doing?__
*102048*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s270_020_son:150-700]]__
Oh no.__
*102049*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s270_030_son:0-2592]]__
Why are they killing him? He didn’t do anything.__
*102050*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s270_040_kra:30-1000]]__
Do not assume.__
*102051*__
[[S:::1610-3650]]__
You are seeing the end of a war, boy.__
*102052*__
[[S:::4040-5750]]__
You do not know what led to this moment.__
*102053*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s270_050_son:27-1569]]__
But he didn’t even defend himself.__
*102054*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s270_060_kra:170-1400]]__
That was his choice.__
*102055*__
[[S:::1830-2750]]__
We make ours.__
*102056*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s273_010_son:35-518]]__
What now?__
*102057*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s273_020_kra:110-1150]]__
The light is near.__
*102058*__
[[S:::1680-2750]]__
Look for a way inside.__
*102059*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s275_010_son:50-2250]]__
Hey, some of the light is peeking out over here.__
*102060*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s275_020_son:67-2404]]__
That did it! Look—more light bridges.__
*102061*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s275_030_kra:60-750]]__
Follow me.__
*102062*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s278_010_son:31-1333]]__
You’re restoring all the pathways…__
*102063*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s280_010_son:80-2737]]__
Uh… I’m not too sure about this.__
*102064*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s282_010_son:124-3550]]__
Yeah… that looks too hard. Maybe we can find the light somewhere else…__
*102065*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s282_020_kra:0-1500]]__
No. Give me a moment.__
*102066*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s282_021_son:0-500]]__
See.__
*102067*__
[[S:::850-1530]]__
It’s too hard.__
*102068*__
[[S:::1970-2650]]__
We should go.__
*102069*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s282_022_kra:0-500]]__
Not yet.__
*102070*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s282_023_son:85-2420]]__
I don’t think you’re gonna get it. We should go.__
*102071*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s282_024_kra:40-970]]__
I will get it.__
*102072*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s282_025_son:0-714]]__
Now can we go?__
*102073*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s282_026_kra:43-1243]]__
I require silence.__
*102074*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s282_030_son:19-549]]__
Aawww…__
*102075*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s282_040_son:27-1199]]__
I mean—we’re in!__
*102076*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s285_010_son:41-1865]]__
I don’t think we’re supposed to be in here.__
*102077*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s285_020_kra:38-601]]__
Quiet.__
*102078*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s290_010_son:44-723]]__
Did you hear that?__
*102079*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s290_020_kra:0-1750]]__
Stay alert and by my side.__
*102080*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s297_010_son:85-2492]]__
Hey… when we make it to the light,__
*102081*__
[[S:::3379-5156]]__
how do you think we get it into the Bifröst?__
*102082*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s297_020_kra:95-1370]]__
The Witch said to step into it.__
*102083*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s297_030_son:0-500]]__
She did?__
*102084*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s297_040_kra:40-1750]]__
When she was ripped away from this realm.__
*102085*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s297_050_son:100-1000]]__
Oh. How’d I miss that?__
*102086*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s297_060_kra:140-2500]]__
You were more concerned with her safety than our goal.__
*102087*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s297_070_son:23-1336]]__
Is that—a bad thing?__
*102088*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s297_080_kra:70-1460]]__
If one prevents the other.__
*102089*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s298_010_son:59-931]]__
That was close.__
*102090*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s295_010_kra:40-1516]]__
Do not stray from me, boy.__
*102091*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s295_020_son:48-1094]]__
You don’t gotta tell me.__
*102092*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s300_010_son:68-2572]]__
Ecch. It’s so… sticky.__
*102093*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s305_010_kra:40-2000]]__
This structure… I see weaknesses.__
*102094*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s310_010_kra:0-500]]__
There.__
*102095*__
[[S:::820-2257]]__
When it falls, be ready.__
*102096*__
[[S:::2465-3732]]__
We will need to move quickly.__
*102097*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s310_020_son:0-450]]__
Okay.__
*102098*__

Shorten the time between your volleys!__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s321_032_son:88-1929]]__
What happened to “accuracy over speed?!”__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s321_033_kra:70-2500]]__
There are many targets—you will not miss!__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s321_040_son:101-1078]]__
They’re everywhere!!__

You have to come back.__

[[S:::2490-3500]]__
You left me here alone…__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s330_020_kra:26-867]]__
Atreus?__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s330_030_son:37-1274]]__
… alone with him.__
*102117*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s330_040_son:50-1250]]__
He always leaves.__
*102118*__
[[S:::1927-2812]]__
He’s never here.__
*102119*__
[[S:::3681-5164]]__
He doesn’t want me and he never will.__
*102120*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s330_050_son:136-1889]]__
I don’t know him and he doesn’t know me.__

[[S:::3586-4800]]__
Doesn’t seem to want to.__
*102122*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s330_060_son:23-1798]]__
I’m strong. I’m smart.__
*102123*__
[[S:::2312-3495]]__
I’m not what he thinks I am.__

[[S:::4102-5258]]__
I know better.__
*102125*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s330_070_son:70-1226]]__
He doesn’t talk to me.__
*102126*__
[[S:::1979-2963]]__
Doesn’t teach me.__
*102127*__
[[S:::3371-7275]]__
It should have been him. Do you hear me? Him... not you.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s330_080_son:0-560]]__
Except…__

[[S:::5490-6490]]__
You know I love him.__
*102131*__
[[S:::7890-9080]]__
I just wish he was better.__

[[S:::10910-12000]]__
I know he can be.__
*102133*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s330_090_son:0-940]]__
So if he tries...__
*102134*__
[[S:::1810-2490]]__
I’ll try.__
*102135*__
[[S:::4010-4870]]__
But if he doesn’t...__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s330_100_son:0-860]]__
… please come back.__
*102137*__
[[S:::1840-3250]]__
I know you’re out there somewhere.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s340_010_son:65-3736]]__
Look! There’s our exit, but there’s no light to make a bridge.__
*102139*__
[[S:::4098-7186]]__
We’re trapped. And the Witch’s bowstring is useless.__
*102140*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s351_010_kra:0-740]]__
On my mark,__
*102141*__
[[S:::1090-2500]]__
loose your arrow into the stone.__
*102142*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s351_020_son:32-662]]__
It worked…__
*102143*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s351_030_kra:90-1500]]__
We can now make our way back.__
*102144*__
[[S:::2310-2900]]__
Come.__
*102145*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s355_010_son:0-2050]]__
My arrow can’t get through all that stuff covering it.__
*102146*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s355_020_son:49-3451]]__
It’s still covered, so I don’t know what you think I can do here.__
*102147*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s355_030_son:38-3863]]__
I’ll keep shooting, but it’s not going to work if you don’t clear that stuff of it.__
*102148*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s355_040_kra:64-877]]__
Atreus…__
*102149*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s355_050_son:0-680]]__
Just saying…__
*102150*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s355_060_son:53-3873]]__
Finally. I’ll light the crystal if you find me an angle.__
*102151*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s355_070_kra:56-3049]]__
Rrrn… let us make our way back up.__
*102152*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s360_010_son:80-1210]]__
That stairway’s blocked.__
*102153*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s363_010_son:0-1170]]__
There’s a Light Crystal ahead—__
*102154*__
[[S:::1640-2590]]__
just laying there.__
*102155*__
[[S:::3370-5500]]__
Maybe it’ll help us get out of this stupid place.__
*102156*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s370_010_son:0-1000]]__
This is blocked too.__
*102157*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s380_010_son:0-1000]]__
Where’re you taking that?__
*102158*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s380_020_kra:77-683]]__
Here.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s380_030_son:30-3820]]__
“May the Light expose and illuminate every dark and unknown corner.”__

Whatever.__
*102161*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s390_010_son:60-1250]]__
You gonna carry that everywhere?__
*102162*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s390_020_kra:0-750]]__
I just might.__
*102163*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s392_010_son:0-910]]__
Oh look.__
*102164*__
[[S:::1370-3000]]__
The blue door that’s not a door.__
*102165*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s392_020_kra:0-1000]]__
… and a sand bowl.__
*102166*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s392_030_son:80-1850]]__
But how do you expect me to reach it?__
*102167*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s394_010_son:0-3470]]__
Maybe instead of looting a sacred temple, we could just get out of here.__
*102168*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s394_020_kra:170-1600]]__
If I want your opinion, boy,__
*102169*__
[[S:::2240-3250]]__
I will ask for it.__
*102170*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s396_010_kra:0-1250]]__
Climb up, have a look.__
*102171*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s396_020_son:0-2826]]__
I can’t get to the bowl from here. It’s too far to jump.__
*102172*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s396_030_kra:0-750]]__
Hold on.__
*102173*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s396_040_son:0-1000]]__

Are you going to do something, or…?__

Of course I have it…__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s398_020_son:0-1309]]__
I hate that guy.__

He will be back.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s400_010_son:80-4289]]__
Oh, no… the boat isn’t here—it’s still back at the other side of the lake!__
*102204*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s400_020_kra:80-1800]]__
Then we go back the way we came.__

[[S:::2450-2950]]__
The lift.__

No…__

Then?__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s403_010_son:55-1749]]__
There isn’t a way back up from here you know.__

I know.__

Great. Now I can barely see.__

How are we supposed to get across without a crystal?__

There’s a room just over there.__

Boy…__

If need be.__

We can use the same sand bowl that brought us down the first time.__

Do you want to tell me something?__

I said, the only time you care to talk to me is when you need me to translate for you.__

[[S:::4656-5623]]__
If mom was here—__

Thankful.__
*102263*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s430_020_son:100-800]]__
We did something good.__
*102264*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s430_030_kra:63-630]]__
Hurm.__
*102265*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s440_010_son:0-2747]]__
Wait… I don’t understand. It can’t be.__
*102266*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s440_020_kra:10-253]]__
Mm?__
*102267*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s440_030_son:0-1160]]__
I heard the voices again,__
*102268*__
[[S:::1780-2460]]__
just for a bit. I__
*102269*__
[[S:::3010-3750]]__
must have heard wrong.__
*102270*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s440_040_kra:30-362]]__
What?__
*102271*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s440_050_son:60-460]]__
They said:__
*102272*__
[[S:::880-2470]]__
“You’ve made a grave mistake,”__
*102273*__
[[S:::2920-3690]]__
and then something about__
*102274*__
[[S:::4240-5200]]__
“the oppressors.”__
*102275*__
[[S:::5720-6900]]__
We helped the right side.__
*102276*__
[[S:::7490-8000]]__
Didn’t we?__
*102277*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s440_060_kra:40-2700]]__
We have what we came for and can now finish our journey.__
*102278*__
[[S:::3330-4000]]__
That is enough.__
*102279*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s440_070_son:30-550]]__
I understand.__
*102280*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s450_010_son:36-496]]__
What now?__
*102281*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s450_020_kra:60-860]]__
We have the Light.__
*102282*__
[[S:::1460-2000]]__
To Midgard.__
*102283*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s450_030_son:0-800]]__
Oooooor…__
*102284*__
[[S:::1200-2660]]__
we could explore some more.__
*102285*__
[[S:::3060-3410]]__
I mean,__
*102286*__
[[S:::3880-6620]]__
I think mom would have wanted me to see other realms, right?__
*102287*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s450_040_kra:50-349]]__
Mm.__
*102288*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s450_050_son:0-550]]__
Yes!__
*102289*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl02_s263_010_son_stem:5500-11966]]__
Brok! We just came back from another realm and we met your brother. Wait—not in that order.__
*102290*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl02_s263_010_brk_stem:13120-16030]]__
Did you let that seed-sop put hand to your blade?__
*102291*__
[[S:::17610-20130]]__
You do know he lost his talent, right?__
*102292*__
[[S:::20630-22700]]__
Just up and left him one day—__
*102293*__
[[S:::23520-25490]]__
tried taking me down with him.__
*102294*__
[[S:::28530-30259]]__
Did he botch up our girl?__
*102295*__
[[S:::39586-45309]]__
Hm... well, even a blind pig farts up a truffle now and again.__
*102296*__
[[S:::45955-48002]]__
But do you know what really counts?__
*102297*__
[[S:::49583-53862]]__
Consistency. And I got that comin’ outta ALLA my parts.__
*102298*__
[[S:::59728-60715]]__
It’s better.__
*102299*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl02_s263_010_kra_stem:32090-33120]]__
Quite the opposite...__
*102300*__
[[S:::58180-59405]]__
What did you do?__
*102301*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl02_s080_010_kra_stem:0-1000]]__
How does it work?__
*102302*__
[[S:::18990-19640]]__
What now?__
*102303*__
[[S:::114920-115900]]__
Yes.__
*102304*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl02_s080_010_fre_stem:1550-5830]]__
You will need this—a Bifröst—to create travel between realms.__
*102305*__
[[S:::7220-10370]]__
It can capture, hold, and transfer the Light of Alfheim.__
*102306*__
[[S:::11250-12610]]__
Place the Bifröst there.__
*102307*__
[[S:::20300-21190]]__
Give it a moment.__
*102308*__
[[S:::21690-24490]]__
The temple needs time to wake up from its long slumber.__
*102309*__
[[S:::25310-26700]]__
It is from this room—__
*102310*__
[[S:::27050-28350]]__
and this room alone—__
*102311*__
[[S:::28720-31310]]__
that you will be able to cross between realms.__
*102312*__
[[S:::33960-37530]]__
What you see before you represents the temple in which we stand,__
*102313*__
[[S:::38060-41780]]__
as well as the realm towers that encircle the Lake of Nine outside.__
*102314*__
[[S:::42750-47970]]__
All the realms exist in the same physical space, reflections of each other.__
*102315*__
[[S:::48110-53850]]__
These doors, the towers outside, and the nine realms are all intertwined__
*102316*__
[[S:::53850-57360]]__
and co-existing on the branches of the World Tree—__
*102317*__
[[S:::57540-60790]]__
separated only by the Bifröst light of Alfheim.__
*102318*__
[[S:::61590-64480]]__
This place can focus and control that light.__
*102319*__
[[S:::66890-73550]]__
Only an artistic representation of it. No, the Yggdrasil is much, much more than this.__
*102320*__
[[S:::73550-79050]]__
The Tree of Life is bound to the fate of the world, just as we are bound to it.__
*102321*__
[[S:::80070-86520]]__
The tree nourishes our soils. The dew from its leaves feeds our valleys and rivers.__
*102322*__
[[S:::87110-92020]]__
The tree’s very existence supports all of creation along its boughs—__
*102323*__
[[S:::92020-96050]]__
its life energy interwoven into the tapestry of life…__
*102324*__
[[S:::96050-100980]]__
birth, growth, death, and rebirth…__
*102325*__
[[S:::100980-105660]]__
every strand, transcending time, transcending space.__
*102326*__
[[S:::105660-107750]]__
Everything comes back to the tree.__
*102327*__
[[S:::108830-114920]]__
So… that’s how it works. But I’m guessing you were looking for a more practical answer.__
*102328*__
[[S:::116490-117540]]__
Very well…__
*102329*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl02_s080_010_son_stem:65060-66180]]__
And is this the World Tree?__
*102330*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s002_010_fre:130-820]]__
Watch your step.__
*102331*__
[[S:::1310-2000]]__
Just along here.__
*102332*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s002_020_son:40-4030]]__
You sure? We came through here before and there’s no way back across.__
*102333*__
[[S:::4530-5030]]__
See?__
*102334*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s002_030_fre:130-1000]]__
Is that so?__
*102335*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s002_040_fre:120-1250]]__
Let me show you something.__
*102336*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s002_050_fre:120-750]]__
Are you watching?__
*102337*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s002_051_fre:176-1034]]__
Ljósta!__
*102338*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s002_060_son:51-1589]]__
What? It’s solid!__
*102339*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s002_070_fre:130-1400]]__
Elven architecture.__
*102340*__
[[S:::1790-4100]]__
My bowstring was soaked in the Light of Alfheim.__
*102341*__
[[S:::4610-7180]]__
It can now reawaken the magic of the Elves.__
*102342*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s002_080_son:80-2281]]__
Wait… it won’t just disappear, will it?__
*102343*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s002_090_fre:120-1860]]__
Not as long as the light shines free.__
*102344*__
[[S:::2940-3450]]__
This way.__
*102345*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s002_100_son:940-1530]]__
I want one.__
*102346*__
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_cl02_s004_006_fre:165-675]]__
Rót!__
*102347*__
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_cl02_s004_006_fre_a:130-350]]__
Rót!__
*102348*__
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_cl02_s004_006_fre_b:183-803]]__
Rót!__
*102349*__
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_cl02_s004_006_fre_c:130-650]]__
Rót!__
*102350*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s004_010_son:0-830]]__
Those roots—__
*102351*__
[[S:::1360-2650]]__
what kind of magic is that?__
*102352*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s004_020_fre:5-779]]__
It’s Vanir.__
*102353*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s004_030_son:0-750]]__
From Vanaheim?__
*102354*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s004_040_fre:0-630]]__
You know of it?__
*102355*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s004_050_son:0-690]]__
Just stories.__
*102356*__
[[S:::1190-3150]]__
Mother didn’t say much about the Vanir gods,__
*102357*__
[[S:::3630-5560]]__
just that they’re always at war with the Aesir.__
*102358*__
[[S:::6020-8500]]__
Guess compared to Odin and Thor, they’re the good guys.__
*102359*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl02_s004_060_kra:60-1970]]__
There are no “good” gods, boy.__
*102360*__
[[S:::2320-3250]]__
Thought I taught you that.__
*102361*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s004_070_fre:130-2000]]__
When you’re ready—through these doors.__
*102362*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s005_010_fre:120-1240]]__
The tongue of Niflheim.__
*102363*__
[[S:::1670-3980]]__
A foul place of ice and mists…__
*102364*__
[[S:::4750-5700]]__
and Dwarven mischief.__
*102365*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s005_020_fre:130-1680]]__
Those runes are of Muspelheim,__
*102366*__
[[S:::2050-3040]]__
the fire realm.__
*102367*__
[[S:::3690-5090]]__
No place for children,__
*102368*__
[[S:::5810-6750]]__
even brave ones.__
*102369*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s005_030_son:20-1200]]__
I still can’t read these.__
*102370*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s005_040_son:41-1356]]__
These are the ones I can’t read.__
*102371*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s005_050_son:30-700]]__
I told you,__
*102372*__
[[S:::1240-2450]]__
we should come back with a cipher.__
*102373*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s010_010_son:50-3160]]__
The boat? But the Witch is showing us to the temple, remember?__
*102374*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s020_010_fre:130-1090]]__
Týr’s Temple.__
*102375*__
[[S:::1830-3648]]__
Built with help from the Giants,__
*102376*__
[[S:::3875-8040]]__
Great Týr used it to travel the nine realms and keep the peace between them.__
*102377*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s020_020_son:190-3550]]__
Doesn’t seem very peaceful. Everywhere we go, we’re attacked.__
*102378*__
[[S:::4030-5250]]__
Especially by dead things.__
*102379*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s020_030_fre:130-2470]]__
The risen dead grow ever more numerous.__
*102380*__
[[S:::3560-6440]]__
Once, the roads and trails would have been full of people.__
*102381*__
[[S:::7190-9060]]__
Now, all have hid or fled,__
*102382*__
[[S:::9450-10630]]__
save for the reavers__
*102383*__
[[S:::11010-13250]]__
savage enough to survive in such a world.__
*102384*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s025_010_fre:0-2030]]__
The risen dead grow ever more numerous.__
*102385*__
[[S:::2649-4630]]__
I fear for the future of this realm.__
*102386*__
[[S:::5249-5709]]__
Once,__
*102387*__
[[S:::6070-8450]]__
the roads and trails would have been full of people.__
*102388*__
[[S:::9090-14750]]__
Now, all have hid or fled, save for reavers savage enough to survive in such a world.__
*102389*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s025_020_son:28-668]]__
And us!__
*102390*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s025_030_fre:0-1080]]__
Yes, and you.__
*102391*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s030_010_fre:0-1750]]__
Make a right at the bottom of these stairs.__
*102392*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s030_020_fre:110-2940]]__
Please, take those stairs down and turn right.__
*102393*__
[[S:::3330-4250]]__
I’ll be waiting up here.__
*102394*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s030_030_son:20-500]]__
Hey,__
*102395*__
[[S:::660-2000]]__
another one of those light crystals.__
*102396*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s030_040_fre:130-2250]]__
Wait there while I reawaken the light.__
*102397*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s030_041_fre:165-1055]]__
Ljósta!__
*102398*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s030_050_son:49-651]]__
That did it.__
*102399*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_005_son:0-1326]]__
What are we doing exactly?__
*102400*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_006_fre:120-1460]]__
Mending the disrepair.__
*102401*__
[[S:::2020-3750]]__
Start by lifting that axle.__
*102402*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_010_fre:390-2250]]__
Good! Now push it back into place.__
*102403*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_015_fre:200-2500]]__
Now realign the wheel onto the track.__
*102404*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_016_fre:162-3212]]__
Perfect! Now push the bridge along the track.__
*102405*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_020_son:24-545]]__
Whuh—?__
*102406*__
[[S:::1255-2920]]__
The whole entire bridge is turning!__
*102407*__
[[S:::3550-5244]]__
How is the whole entire bridge turning?__
*102408*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_030_son:150-648]]__
Boy,__
*102409*__
[[S:::1290-2438]]__
you’re really strong.__
*102410*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_033_fre:110-3750]]__
Just keep pushing until the bridge reaches its first position.__
*102411*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_037_fre:120-1000]]__
Tired yet?__
*102412*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_040_kra:53-584]]__
NO.__
*102413*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_043_son:83-1459]]__
He’s always been really strong!__
*102414*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_047_fre:130-1000]]__
I can see that!__
*102415*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_050_son:50-1180]]__
You are tired though, right?__
*102416*__
[[S:::1690-2500]]__
You’re just saying that?__
*102417*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_053_kra:54-970]]__
I am fine.__
*102418*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_057_son:74-647]]__
Wow.__
*102419*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_058_son:70-940]]__
So about the dead…__
*102420*__
[[S:::1760-3460]]__
we heard someone call them “Hel-Walkers”.__
*102421*__
[[S:::4300-5000]]__
But what are they?__
*102422*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_059_fre:140-4500]]__
They are poor, restless souls, denied their judgement and their peace.__
*102423*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_061_son:40-670]]__
By what?__
*102424*__
[[S:::1100-2567]]__
Could Vanir magic raise the dead?__
*102425*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_062_fre:120-1685]]__
It could, once,__
*102426*__
[[S:::2210-3690]]__
but this is no spell.__
*102427*__
[[S:::4510-8250]]__
This plague of dead is but a symptom of a world out of balance.__
*102428*__
[[S:::8970-12540]]__
Something, or someone, has meddled with powerful forces.__
*102429*__
[[S:::13400-15019]]__
That is all I know for sure.__
*102430*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_060_fre:110-950]]__
Keep going!__
*102431*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_063_fre:90-1299]]__
Almost there!__
*102432*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_067_fre:230-1887]]__
Just a little more to go!__
*102433*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_070_fre:91-3482]]__
That’s perfect! Come back up! We’re ready now!__
*102434*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_080_fre:40-1190]]__
You’re not done yet!__
*102435*__
[[S:::1590-6702]]__
You have to push the bridge all the way to the end for the mechanism to reset.__
*102436*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_090_son:0-3585]]__
I think she said you have to push the bridge all the way to the end for the something to get reset.__
*102437*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_100_son:65-1119]]__
That was impressive.__
*102438*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_110_son:21-1177]]__
You didn’t hurt your back, did you?__
*102439*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_120_kra:0-1739]]__
I did not hurt my back.__
*102440*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s050_010_fre:140-1250]]__
Through these doors.__
*102441*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s050_020_son:0-500]]__
Wait.__
*102442*__
[[S:::890-3354]]__
So did the Giants or the Elves build Týr’s temple?__
*102443*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s050_030_fre:0-2391]]__
All the races helped with its construction.__
*102444*__
[[S:::2734-7486]]__
It was the last great act of cooperation between the realms before the peace disappeared for good.__
*102445*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s050_040_son:0-630]]__
We’re leaving?__
*102446*__
[[S:::1110-2390]]__
But the Witch is showing us something.__
*102447*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl02_s050_050_kra:0-750]]__
She will wait.__
*102448*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s050_060_son:0-1000]]__
Wow, okay.__
*102449*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s050_070_fre:110-1250]]__
I was wondering if you’d ever come back.__
*102450*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s060_005_fre:166-935]]__
Ljósta!__
*102451*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s060_005_fre_a:240-750]]__
Ljósta!__
*102452*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s060_005_fre_b:172-953]]__
Ljósta!__
*102453*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s060_010_son:57-1442]]__
Your bowstring stopped glowing.__
*102454*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s060_020_fre:0-1590]]__
Its power is now depleted.__
*102455*__
[[S:::2220-5710]]__
Only a few nocks of magic remained in the bowstring, and we used them.__
*102456*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s060_030_fre:0-814]]__
Your bow please.__
*102457*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s060_040_fre:0-4566]]__
Once you claim the Light of Alfheim, infuse the bowstring with its power. Don’t forget!__
*102458*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s060_050_son:41-1596]]__
You talk like you’re not coming with us.__
*102459*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s060_060_fre:43-3795]]__
I’ll try, but measures were taken to keep me trapped in Midgard.__
*102460*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl02_s060_070_kra:0-569]]__
Why?__
*102461*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s060_080_fre:0-1520]]__
The gods don’t care for me much.__
*102462*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s070_010_son:0-700]]__
Is this it?__
*102463*__
[[S:::1110-2024]]__
It’s so dark.__
*102464*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s070_015_fre:0-1450]]__
This temple has been asleep,__
*102465*__
[[S:::1840-4500]]__
underwater, for almost a hundred and fifty winters.__
*102466*__
[[S:::4500-7750]]__
It needs only the light of the Bifröst to reawaken.__
*102467*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s070_020_son:44-1647]]__
Those roots don’t look like your magic.__
*102468*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s070_025_fre:130-840]]__
They aren’t.__
*102469*__
[[S:::1320-6250]]__
These roots are part of the great World Tree, and make travel between the realms possible.__
*102470*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s070_030_fre:100-1250]]__
Approach the table.__
*102471*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl02_s070_040_kra:30-750]]__
We will return.__
*102472*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s070_050_fre:120-950]]__
I’ll be waiting.__
*102473*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s070_060_fre:110-750]]__
Over here.__
*102474*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s070_070_fre:0-3900]]__
I can teach you how to travel between realms, but not unless you’re over here.__
*102475*__
[[S:::4420-4950]]__
Come.__
*102476*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_046_fre:100-4190]]__
The bridge you pushed outside is currently positioned to lead to the realm of Vanaheim.__
*102477*__
[[S:::4590-8750]]__
Instead, turn the wheel to our actual destination—Alfheim.__
*102478*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_050_fre:0-2500]]__
You must select the destination realm… Alfheim.__
*102479*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_060_fre:0-1740]]__
Turn the wheel to Alfheim please.__
*102480*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_070_fre:28-1055]]__
Why isn’t he listening to me?__
*102481*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_080_son:0-1250]]__
He gets like this sometimes.__
*102482*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_090_son:0-500]]__
Wait,__
*102483*__
[[S:::700-2360]]__
is this moving the big bridge outside?__
*102484*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_100_fre:0-5750]]__
Yes. The wheel turns the bridge, and the bridge aligns to the different realm towers on the lake outside.__
*102485*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_110_son:110-2000]]__
Wait… there’s no tower on this one.__
*102486*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_110_fre:0-3680]]__
Correct. He’s turning the bridge so it aligns to the appropriate realm.__
*102487*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_120_fre:0-2710]]__
And that’s why realm travel to Jötunheim is impossible.__
*102488*__
[[S:::3320-7220]]__
Without a tower for the bridge to lock into, the sequence can’t begin.__
*102489*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_130_fre:60-3890]]__
Every realm has a travel rune that unlocks the bridge to that realm.__
*102490*__
[[S:::4370-6260]]__
I’m giving you the one for Alfheim.__
*102491*__
[[S:::6630-8500]]__
Now you can lock in your destination__
*102492*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_140_fre:40-4000]]__
We’re ready. Remember to take the Bifröst—you don’t want to lose that.__
*102493*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_150_fre:80-5000]]__
Now the realm travel bridge will align, and the realm between realms will open.__
*102494*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_010_son:0-680]]__
So…__
*102495*__
[[S:::1220-2097]]__
this isn’t Alfheim?__
*102496*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_020_fre:130-1379]]__
See that giant crystal?__
*102497*__
[[S:::1910-6820]]__
Each realm has a corresponding one that focuses and amplifies the power of the Bifröst,__
*102498*__
[[S:::7074-9061]]__
opening the bridge to that realm.__
*102499*__
[[S:::9460-12750]]__
That’s why realm travel is only possible from this room.__
*102500*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_030_son:30-2195]]__
What about that one realm tower missing from the lake?__
*102501*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_040_fre:130-4470]]__
The Jötunheim tower disappeared from all realms over a hundred winters ago,__
*102502*__
[[S:::4718-6713]]__
when the Giants vanished from Midgard.__
*102503*__
[[S:::7240-10000]]__
Where the tower went and how they moved it remain a mystery.__
*102504*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_050_son:50-1816]]__
It didn’t work. We’re still here.__
*102505*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_060_fre:130-750]]__
Follow me.__
*102506*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_070_kra:60-1250]]__
The Bifröst is dark.__
*102507*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_080_fre:0-1530]]__
This trip was its last use.__
*102508*__
[[S:::2180-4995]]__
There’s no going back until it’s replenished with the Light of Alfheim.__
*102509*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_090_kra:0-1000]]__
So we are trapped.__
*102510*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_100_fre:110-3500]]__
Someone of your ability should have little trouble getting back to Midgard.__
*102511*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_100_fre_a:120-3250]]__
Someone of your ability should have little trouble getting back to Midgard.__
*102512*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_110_son:31-2099]]__
And we’ll be able to make that Black Breath go away?__
*102513*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_120_fre:130-2000]]__
With the captured Light of Alfheim, yes.__
*102514*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_120_fre_a:130-2250]]__
With the captured Light of Alfheim, yes.__
*102515*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s095_010_son:0-1210]]__
Those towers around the bay.__
*102516*__
[[S:::1810-2500]]__
There’s one missing.__
*102517*__
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s095_020_fre:0-1050]]__
You are sharp-eyed.__
*102518*__
[[S:::1630-5690]]__
The Jötunheim tower has been missing for one hundred and seventy winters.__
*102519*__
[[S:::6290-7750]]__
Nobody knows where it went or why.__
*102520*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s010_010_son:0-471]]__
What now?__
*102521*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl03_s010_020_kra:0-890]]__
We have the Light.__
*102522*__
[[S:::1330-2000]]__
To Midgard.__
*102523*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s010_030_son:0-2210]]__
Oooooor… we could explore some more.__
*102524*__
[[S:::2555-3102]]__
I mean,__
*102525*__
[[S:::3413-5334]]__
I think mom would have wanted me to see other realms,__
*102526*__
[[S:::5650-6100]]__
right?__
*102527*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl03_s010_040_kra:28-583]]__
Mm.__
*102528*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s010_050_son:53-565]]__
Yes!__
*102529*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl03_s030_010_kra:30-2500]]__
Do you remember the way back to the Black Breath?__
*102530*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s030_020_son:150-970]]__
Of course.__
*102531*__
[[S:::1570-3740]]__
We need to walk across the bridge to the Vanaheim tower.__
*102532*__
[[S:::4650-5700]]__
Are we going to the Black Breath?__
*102533*__
[[S:::6320-7000]]__
Or exploring?__
*102534*__
[[S:::7900-8400]]__
Your choice.__
*102535*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl03_s030_030_kra:50-870]]__
She is cunning.__
*102536*__
[[S:::1480-3160]]__
That would not have been her end.__
*102537*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s040_010_son:36-3757]]__
Look. We rowed passed that statue of Thor earlier—when we left the Witch’s cave.__
*102538*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl03_s040_020_kra:30-1250]]__
And what direction is that?__
*102539*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s040_030_son:40-3500]]__
It’s mid-morning, the sun is over there, soooo…__
*102540*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s040_040_son:69-2559]]__
That’s south… south-west?__
*102541*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl03_s040_050_kra:30-500]]__
Good.__
*102542*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s050a_010_son:50-1179]]__
I can read these now!__
*102543*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s050a_020_son:50-1270]]__
It says in Muspelheim,__
*102544*__
[[S:::1790-2720]]__
the fire realm,__
*102545*__
[[S:::3180-4590]]__
is the Gauntlet of Surtr.__
*102546*__
[[S:::5770-6270]]__
Like…__
*102547*__
[[S:::6510-7250]]__
a magic glove?__
*102548*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl03_s050a_030_kra:50-1500]]__
Or a series of dangers.__
*102549*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s050a_040_son:40-1000]]__
We should go see sometime.__
*102550*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl03_s050a_050_mmr:150-2000]]__
Our young god knows no fear!__
*102551*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl03_s050a_050_mmr_a:130-2000]]__
Our young god knows no fear!__
*102552*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s050b_010_son:30-1168]]__
I can read these now!__
*102553*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s050b_020_son:0-2590]]__
It says the Gauntlet of Surtr is in Muspelheim.__
*102554*__
[[S:::3760-5140]]__
Is that what those challenges are called?__
*102555*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl03_s050b_030_kra:165-750]]__
It may be.__
*102556*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl03_s050b_040_mmr:50-4000]]__
Ah, that makes sense… who else would be training in a place like Muspelheim?__
*102557*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl03_s050b_050_mmr:80-2000]]__
Have you been going to the fire realm?__
*102558*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s050b_060_son:80-2291]]__
Yeah. We didn’t get too far.__
*102559*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl03_s050b_070_mmr:0-2519]]__
Well, you’re getting stronger all the time.__
*102560*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s050b_080_son:52-758]]__
That’s true…__
*102561*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s055_010_son:80-2202]]__
Did you see something out there? That tower…__
*102562*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl03_s055_020_kra:120-1000]]__
I see no tower.__
*102563*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s055_030_son:60-1140]]__
Maybe I’m seeing things…__
*102564*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s060_010_son:0-570]]__
Oh, look…__
*102565*__
[[S:::1020-3350]]__
the Witch’s magic is still covering those scorn poles.__
*102566*__
[[S:::4410-5310]]__
Saves us some time…__
*102567*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s070_010_son:0-500]]__
Oh,__
*102568*__
[[S:::1270-2510]]__
but her light bridge is gone.__
*102569*__
[[S:::3880-5119]]__
I’d make one myself,__
*102570*__
[[S:::5861-6929]]__
but the crystal’s gone.__
*102571*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s070_020_son:2-2918]]__
There’s the Bifröst crystal. Must have fallen out…__
*102572*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s015_010_son:35-4736]]__
It’s crazy to think that all the realms exist in the same space, one on top of the other.__
*102573*__
[[S:::5456-7729]]__
It’s like this room lets us travel without moving!__
*102574*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s020_010_son:70-1950]]__
Sindri’s Skyway cart is still down there…__
*102575*__
[[S:::2420-3569]]__
if you don’t feel like climbing.__
*102576*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s030_010_son:0-2500]]__
No roots. Guess the Witch never came this way.__
*102577*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s040_010_son:70-2750]]__
Even with the coffin empty, this place is still creepy.__
*102578*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s050_010_son:140-1210]]__
Father? Do you…__
*102579*__
[[S:::1670-2750]]__
do you think I could carry her now?__
*102580*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl02_s050_020_kra:38-500]]__
No.__
*102581*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s050_030_son:0-323]]__
But I—__
*102582*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl02_s050_040_kra:50-1019]]__
I said no.__
*102583*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s050_050_son:87-582]]__
Okay.__
*102584*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s060_010_son:120-2110]]__
So who do you think carved the face in the mountain?__
*102585*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl02_s060_020_kra:40-1250]]__
You would know better than I.__
*102586*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s060_030_son:30-550]]__
Thanks.__
*102587*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl02_s060_040_kra:100-1000]]__
Now watch your step.__
*102588*__
[[S:::1610-3250]]__
Carelessness will only delay us.__
*102589*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s060_050_son:52-695]]__
Right.__
*102590*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s070_010_son:70-1320]]__
Well there’s the Black Breath again.__
*102591*__
[[S:::1690-2250]]__
What do we do now?__
*102592*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl02_s070_020_kra:50-1500]]__
We see if the Witch was right.__
*102593*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s070_030_son:142-1991]]__
It’s working! She was right!__
*102594*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl02_s070_040_kra:70-580]]__
Come.__
*102595*__
[[S:::840-1882]]__
Let us finish this.__
*102596*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s080_010_son:60-790]]__
The path ahead —__
*102597*__
[[S:::1360-1920]]__
it’s blocked.__
*102598*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl02_s080_020_kra:0-750]]__
Then we climb.__
*102599*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s090_010_son:0-4250]]__
You know… mother said the Giants used to visit the Midgard mountains before they disappeared.__
*102600*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl02_s090_020_kra:0-500]]__
Disappeared?__
*102601*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s090_030_son:0-3000]]__
Yeah. I guess they just up and left one day. No one knows why.__
*102602*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl02_s090_040_kra:0-1500]]__
Perhaps they returned to their home.__
*102603*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s090_050_son:80-700]]__
To Jötunheim?__
*102604*__
[[S:::1070-1560]]__
Maybe.__
*102605*__
[[S:::2000-5000]]__
I wonder if the face in the mountain was a tribute to some important Giant?__
*102606*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s100_010_son:0-1530]]__
The mouth… we made it.__
*102607*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl02_s100_020_kra:80-1000]]__
More Black Breath.__
*102608*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s110_010_son:0-660]]__
Where are we going?__
*102609*__
[[S:::1360-2500]]__
The entrance was back there.__
*102610*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl02_s110_020_kra:70-1000]]__
Are you in a hurry?__
*102611*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s110_030_son:0-520]]__
No!__
*102612*__
[[S:::1560-2910]]__
But you normally are.__
*102613*__
[[S:::4010-5250]]__
I’m happy to keep exploring.__
*102614*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s120_010_son:0-1030]]__
You want to leave already?__
*102615*__
[[S:::1880-2750]]__
We just got here.__
*102616*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv04_s330_010_son_stem:2100-3814]]__
Father—she is here!__
*102617*__
[[S:::5540-7987]]__
It is so good to see you again!__
*102618*__
[[S:::8130-9864]]__
I knew you weren’t dead.__
*102619*__
[[S:::11987-15047]]__
Oh…Can you bring a head back to life?__
*102620*__
[[S:::26039-27508]]__
They were a gift…__
*102621*__
[[S:::42470-46234]]__
I understand! If I see them, I’ll destroy them!__
*102622*__
[[S:::82730-83681]]__
Please?__
*102623*__
[[S:::138991-140532]]__
It worked!__
*102624*__
[[S:::169787-172676]]__
Freya? The goddess Freya?__
*102625*__
[[S:::196831-197555]]__
But—__
*102626*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv04_s330_010_fre_stem:10427-11990]]__
Hello…!__
*102627*__
[[S:::16541-18183]]__
I’m… not sure I understand what…__
*102628*__
[[S:::18511-21737]]__
Wait… Where did you get those?__
*102629*__
[[S:::21737-26293]]__
The arrows… Give them to me. NOW.__
*102630*__
[[S:::30624-37710]]__
These arrows are dangerous… they’re wicked. You find any more, you destroy them. Understand?__
*102631*__
[[S:::39188-42266]]__
DO YOU UNDERSTAND? SAY IT!__
*102632*__
[[S:::48240-50617]]__
It’s all I ask. Forgive me.__
*102633*__
[[S:::51257-55629]]__
Please—take my arrows in their place. I have no need for them anymore.__
*102634*__
[[S:::61324-65195]]__
Now… what’s this about a head?__
*102635*__
[[S:::69319-73666]]__
Do you have any idea who this is? Did you kill him?__
*102636*__
[[S:::78048-81965]]__
Me? Are you sure you heard him right?__
*102637*__
[[S:::87162-88581]]__
Take him to the table.__
*102638*__
[[S:::89047-97732]]__
Heimili. It’s been a long time since I’ve practiced the Old magic. Hold him there—let’s have a look.__
*102639*__
[[S:::98226-106484]]__
Well, thankfully, his head hasn’t decayed much and his brain is still intact. Nice, clean cut.__
*102640*__
[[S:::108192-113184]]__
Cutting off his head of all people… I sure hope you know what you’re doing.__
*102641*__
[[S:::114497-118870]]__
Now hold his head under the water and don’t let go. I mean it.__
*102642*__
[[S:::131283-132422]]__
That’s enough.__
*102643*__
[[S:::141185-142077]]__
Let me see him.__
*102644*__
[[S:::145882-148301]]__
Mimir… you there?__
*102645*__
[[S:::149819-151140]]__
Good.__
*102646*__
[[S:::156968-162120]]__
What I did, I did for them. As far as I’m concerned, death suits you better.__
*102647*__
[[S:::175174-179066]]__
When word gets out that Mimir is free, the wrath of Odin won’t be far behind.__
*102648*__
[[S:::181841-186066]]__
Leader of the Vanir once, yes… but no longer.__
*102649*__
[[S:::189313-193443]]__
Are you really going to lecture me about that?__
*102650*__
[[S:::200770-202201]]__
You’re welcome!__
*102651*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv04_s330_010_kra_stem:26810-28716]]__
Do as she says, boy.__
*102652*__
[[S:::74320-75340]]__
At his request.__
*102653*__
[[S:::76090-78168]]__
He claimed you could revive him.__
*102654*__
[[S:::179280-180240]]__
You are a god…..__
*102655*__
[[S:::185230-187550]]__
You did not think it important to tell me?__
*102656*__
[[S:::194816-198372]]__
We are leaving, boy. Now.__
*102657*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv04_s330_010_mmr_stem:148220-148670]]__
Yes…__
*102658*__
[[S:::151770-152310]]__
Oh…__
*102659*__
[[S:::153150-154870]]__
Hello, Freya. Been a long time!__
*102660*__
[[S:::155530-156490]]__
You look well.__
*102661*__
[[S:::161824-164705]]__
I’d bow if I could, your majesty. Forgive me—__
*102662*__
[[S:::165180-170403]]__
had I known the “Witch in the Woods” was Freya herself, I never would have suggested this.__
*102663*__
[[S:::172290-172850]]__
You didn’t know either?__
*102664*__
[[S:::174680-175634]]__
Sorry.__
*102665*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s010_010_son:100-1554]]__
I know she’s really powerful,__
*102666*__
[[S:::1960-4220]]__
but you really think the Witch can bring a head back to life?__
*102667*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s010_020_kra:0-1780]]__
She seems competent in her craft.__
*102668*__
[[S:::2480-3420]]__
And we have nothing to lose.__
*102669*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s010_030_son:30-3231]]__
If she can’t bring it back to life, can we keep the head?__
*102670*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s010_040_kra:0-500]]__
No.__
*102671*__
[[S:::1540-2930]]__
But you may feed it to the fish.__
*102672*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s010_050_son:90-594]]__
Okay!__
*102673*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s030_010_son:100-1000]]__
And now the door’s gone.__
*102674*__
[[S:::2250-3820]]__
The Witch’s turtle must be standing up.__
*102675*__
[[S:::5040-6250]]__
So how do we get back up there?__
*102676*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s040_010_son:0-3250]]__
She must have some way of getting back to the surface when the turtle’s standing.__
*102677*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s040_020_kra:17-707]]__
Keep looking.__
*102678*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s040_030_son:70-3111]]__
Maybe there’s a way we couldn’t get through before, but now we can.__
*102679*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s040_040_son:0-500]]__
Wait—__
*102680*__
[[S:::770-2500]]__
I bet my new arrows could shatter something?__
*102681*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s040_050_son:60-1050]]__
I bet this’ll lead out…__
*102682*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s050_010_son:90-3849]]__
“Turn back, Aesir.” Guess the gods aren’t welcome here.__
*102683*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s060_010_son:66-2806]]__
(gasps) There he is! I hope he remembers us.__
*102684*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s070_010_son:64-2589]]__
“Of old was the age / When Ymir lived”.__
*102685*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s090_010_son:150-1250]]__
“Death to the Raven God,__
*102686*__
[[S:::1950-2750]]__
Lord of the Hanged”.__
*102687*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s090_020_mmr:30-1340]]__
That’s talking about Odin.__
*102688*__
[[S:::1690-4500]]__
He’s known by many names, not all of them nice.__
*102689*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s100_010_son:0-2640]]__
“Seiðr níðings upon all who trespass”.__
*102690*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s100_020_mmr:50-4250]]__
Níðings are ancient curses. Old magic. Best to avoid.__
*102691*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_010_son:80-1250]]__
Another one of those sand bowls.__
*102692*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_020_son:0-800]]__
Want me to read this one?__
*102693*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_030_kra:0-890]]__
What does it say?__
*102694*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_040_son:80-1580]]__
“Falcon, Hawk, and Turtle-Dove /__
*102695*__
[[S:::2120-3540]]__
Swim aloft in oceans above.”__
*102696*__
[[S:::5230-5690]]__
Huh?__
*102697*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_050_kra:0-1500]]__
Those runes on the rock.__
*102698*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_051_son:9-2714]]__
They don’t spell anything. It’s gibberish.__
*102699*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_060_son:122-2076]]__
I’m sure we’ll find the answer around here somewhere…__
*102700*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_070_kra:50-700]]__
Here, boy.__
*102701*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_080_son:4-5885]]__
I know those runes. That’s “vindr”. Wind! Must be for that sand bowl down there.__
*102702*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_081_kra:0-500]]__
Here, boy.__
*102703*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_082_son:50-2600]]__
Oh! The rest of the runes were hidden over the hill.__
*102704*__
[[S:::3260-4750]]__
That’s “vindr”. Wind!__
*102705*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_090_kra:0-1000]]__
Back to the sand bowl.__
*102706*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_091_kra:0-750]]__
What does it say?__
*102707*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_092_son:0-2290]]__
“Falcon, Hawk, and Turtle-Dove /__
*102708*__
[[S:::2920-4856]]__
Swim aloft in oceans above.”__
*102709*__
[[S:::5780-6369]]__
Ah—__
*102710*__
[[S:::6951-7490]]__
“Wind”…__
*102711*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_093_son:24-762]]__
Vindr…__
*102712*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_100_kra:31-653]]__
Draw it.__
*102713*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_110_son:69-596]]__
Sir.__
*102714*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_120_son:54-775]]__
Vindr…__
*102715*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_130_son:90-823]]__
Look what it did!__
*102716*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s120_010_son:80-990]]__
How’s it going, Chaurli?__
*102717*__
[[S:::1610-2410]]__
Is your Witch friend here?__
*102718*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s120_020_kra:50-1500]]__
What is that name?__
*102719*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s120_030_son:84-4789]]__
That’s what he told me it was—or what it sounded like in my head anyway. Chaurli!__
*102720*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_010_son:49-1086]]__
Why did you do that?__
*102721*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_020_kra:0-1090]]__
We cannot trust her.__
*102722*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_030_son:47-1046]]__
Because she’s a god?__
*102723*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_040_kra:32-1713]]__
Have I taught you nothing, boy?__
*102724*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_050_son:95-1369]]__
But she’s helped us a lot.__
*102725*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_060_kra:0-750]]__
She lied.__
*102726*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_070_mmr:30-1730]]__
Some people value their privacy.__
*102727*__
[[S:::2140-3460]]__
Best not to judge, brother.__
*102728*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_080_kra:0-1930]]__
When I require your counsel, Head,__
*102729*__
[[S:::2340-2940]]__
I will ask.__
*102730*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_090_mmr:0-840]]__
Fair enough.__
*102731*__
[[S:::1430-5750]]__
Get me to Týr’s temple, in the Lake of the Nine, and I’ll get you to Jötunheim as promised.__
*102732*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_100_son:0-760]]__
We know the temple.__
*102733*__
[[S:::1150-1750]]__
What’s there?__
*102734*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_110_mmr:50-4500]]__
Only the last living Giant in Midgard. Who better to tell us the way?__
*102735*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_120_son:80-1047]]__
The World Serpent?__
*102736*__
[[S:::1652-2050]]__
Wait—__
*102737*__
[[S:::2204-3189]]__
do you know how to talk to him?__
*102738*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_130_mmr:30-740]]__
Indeed.__
*102739*__
[[S:::1170-4840]]__
He speaks an obscure tongue, more ancient even than these mountains.__
*102740*__
[[S:::5310-9228]]__
None are left in Midgard who speak it. Except, of course, for me.__
*102741*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_140_son:18-733]]__
You do?__
*102742*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_150_mmr:30-5555]]__
It’s true. You wouldn’t know it to look at him, but Jörmungandr is a sparkling conversationalist.__
*102743*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_080_son:160-720]]__
Oh boy,__
*102744*__
[[S:::1260-2250]]__
Dad really is talking.__
*102745*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_100_kra:19-1717]]__
And giving orders.__
*102746*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_125_son:140-890]]__
I’m Atreus.__
*102747*__
[[S:::1410-2190]]__
He’s Kratos.__
*102748*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s140_010_mmr:0-1270]]__
Right then—Jötunheim!__
*102749*__
[[S:::1950-6120]]__
First, row us to Týr’s temple at the center of the bay, if you know where that is.__
*102750*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s140_020_son:50-1360]]__
Yeah, we’ve been there a bunch.__
*102751*__
[[S:::1870-2455]]__
Why there?__
*102752*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s140_030_mmr:0-4750]]__
Well, if you want to reach the secret realm of the Giants, I suggest we ask a Giant.__
*102753*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s140_040_son:50-710]]__
The serpent?__
*102754*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s140_050_mmr:0-180]]__
Ah!__
*102755*__
[[S:::810-1750]]__
So you’ve seen him?__
*102756*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s140_060_son:70-650]]__
We met,__
*102757*__
[[S:::1090-1920]]__
I guess…__
*102758*__
[[S:::2540-2780]]__
but__
*102759*__
[[S:::3180-4220]]__
we didn’t know the language.__
*102760*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s140_070_mmr:20-470]]__
Indeed.__
*102761*__
[[S:::1070-4940]]__
He speaks an obscure tongue, more ancient even than these mountains.__
*102762*__
[[S:::5509-7679]]__
None are left in Midgard who speak it.__
*102763*__
[[S:::8290-10249]]__
Except, of course, for me.__
*102764*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s140_080_son:48-590]]__
You do?__
*102765*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s140_090_mmr:0-490]]__
It’s true.__
*102766*__
[[S:::1090-5500]]__
You wouldn’t know it to look at him, but Jörmungandr is a sparkling conversationalist.__
*102767*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s140_100_son:59-2401]]__
Okay! Then let’s go talk to a snake.__
*102768*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s150_010_son:0-1070]]__
She won’t answer the door.__
*102769*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s150_020_mmr:0-2340]]__
Did not leave her in the best of moods, did you?__
*102770*__
[[S:::2830-5000]]__
Frankly, I’m surprised you’d want to come back here…__
*102771*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s150_030_mmr:42-1912]]__
Oughtn’t we leave well enough alone, brother?__
*102772*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s150_040_son:50-610]]__
Yeah.__
*102773*__
[[S:::1160-3500]]__
She already probably won’t ever talk to us again.__
*102774*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl10_s010_010_son:0-4650]]__
We go where we want, we do what we want, and now we’re gonna go see the Giants!__
*102775*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl10_s010_020_mmr:0-510]]__
Aye!__
*102776*__
[[S:::743-2955]]__
Having learned that travel rune to Jötunheim,__
*102777*__
[[S:::3077-5289]]__
we can now head back to the gateway on top of the peak,__
*102778*__
[[S:::5289-7421]]__
and put that magic chisel to good use.__
*102779*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl10_s010_030_son:50-2330]]__
Nobody’s getting in our way this time! Come on!__
*102780*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl10_s020_010_son:88-3470]]__
I’m gonna tell Sindri I’m a god. I’d like to see the look on his face.__
*102781*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl10_s020_020_kra:140-650]]__
No.__
*102782*__
[[S:::1010-2960]]__
I may have kept your secret too long…__
*102783*__
[[S:::3460-5750]]__
but now you will keep OUR secret.__
*102784*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl10_s020_030_son:59-608]]__
Huh.__
*102785*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl10_s030_010_son:190-1340]]__
So... why should we hide what we are?__
*102786*__
[[S:::1810-2940]]__
Secrets are Odin’s way.__
*102787*__
[[S:::3470-4470]]__
Shouldn’t we be open,__
*102788*__
[[S:::5000-5500]]__
like Týr?__
*102789*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl10_s030_020_kra:110-2700]]__
Týr kept secrets too. For good reasons.__
*102790*__
[[S:::3190-4240]]__
To protect people.__
*102791*__
[[S:::4810-6250]]__
It is wiser to be discreet.__
*102792*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl10_s030_030_son:127-3187]]__
That doesn’t mean you should lie to your friends, or your family…__
*102793*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl10_s030_040_mmr:137-3830]]__
I’m sure Sindri would understand and do the same, lad. Don’t fret.__
*102794*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl10_s025_010_son:40-590]]__
Oh yeah,__
*102795*__
[[S:::1030-2000]]__
I can translate this now…__
*102796*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl10_s025_020_son:20-790]]__
“Niflheim,__
*102797*__
[[S:::1330-2750]]__
land of fog and fortune”__
*102798*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl10_s025_030_mmr:100-3250]]__
Aye, and a bloody infinite number of traps…__
*102799*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl10_s025_030_mmr_a:110-3336]]__
Aye, and a bloody infinite number of traps…__
*102800*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl10_s025_040_son:50-2000]]__
Oh yeah, I can translate this now…__
*102801*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl10_s025_050_son:40-840]]__
“Niflheim,__
*102802*__
[[S:::1340-2730]]__
land of fog and fortune.”__
*102803*__
[[S:::3980-6000]]__
Hey, nobody mentioned fortune—__
*102804*__
[[S:::6750-7750]]__
we should go there sometime!__
*102805*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl04_s010_010_kra:150-2500]]__
Do you remember the way back to the Witch from here?__
*102806*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl04_s010_020_son:50-600]]__
That way!__
*102807*__
[[S:::970-2330]]__
Behind the big statue of Thor.__
*102808*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl04_s010_030_kra:31-503]]__
Correct.__
*102809*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl04_s020_010_son:0-2210]]__
Oh. Guess we’re not going back to the Witch just yet.__
*102810*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl04_s030_010_kra:0-1750]]__
Boy, what is the path back to the Witch?__
*102811*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl04_s030_020_son:0-1150]]__
First we need to find a boat.__
*102812*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl04_s040_010_son:0-510]]__
Weird.__
*102813*__
[[S:::1140-3250]]__
I just saw a glint of light coming off the hammer…__
*102814*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl04_s040_020_kra:9-1575]]__
That is not important now.__
*102815*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl04_s040_030_son:0-460]]__
I know.__
*102816*__
[[S:::1010-1690]]__
Just saying…__
*102817*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl04_s320_010_son_stem:2080-2660]]__
Brok!__
*102818*__
[[S:::4011-4644]]__
Brok…!!__
*102819*__
[[S:::5805-6384]]__
Brok!!!__
*102820*__
[[S:::29976-31166]]__
Saw your brother again!__
*102821*__
[[S:::61625-62340]]__
I guess…__
*102822*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl04_s320_010_brk_stem:6354-14004]]__
WHAT? I’m on a fuckin’ break. You don’t hear me screechin’ at you whenever you’re twiddling your short and curlies.__
*102823*__
[[S:::16354-23140]]__
Oh fer… Well, you already soiled my solitude, so ya may as well join me.__
*102824*__
[[S:::25972-28728]]__
Good. That’s not what I was offerin’.__
*102825*__
[[S:::31616-33238]]__
Congratulations.__
*102826*__
[[S:::34841-42044]]__
And I’m sure you let him go and roger my axe good and plenty again. Let’s see the damage…__
*102827*__
[[S:::48602-54965]]__
Little canker-throat wouldn’t know proper weight and balance if it were dangling off his chut.__
*102828*__
[[S:::58935-60734]]__
He eating well enough?__
*102829*__
[[S:::62668-63396]]__
Good.__
*102830*__
[[S:::66061-67039]]__
All better.__
*102831*__
[[S:::73238-75534]]__
Now what the fuck else you want, huh?__
*102832*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl04_s320_010_kra_stem:13980-15326]]__
Leave him, boy.__
*102833*__
[[S:::24090-25320]]__
We are not hungry.__
*102834*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s005_010_son:0-1499]]__
Mimir, we’re in the lake.__
*102835*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s005_020_mmr:130-550]]__
Oh!__
*102836*__
[[S:::800-1473]]__
Let me see!__
*102837*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s005_030_mmr:140-2000]]__
Perfect—dock us near the bridge!__
*102838*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s005_040_son:300-1130]]__
This is nasty.__
*102839*__
[[S:::1630-3150]]__
I can see the hole where food goes down…__
*102840*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s005_050_mmr:144-2031]]__
Do you want to feed me something and see what happens?__
*102841*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s005_060_kra:150-1750]]__
Do not waste our food, boy.__
*102842*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s005_070_son:112-697]]__
Sir.__
*102843*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s005_080_mmr:120-1070]]__
Spoil-sport.__
*102844*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s010_010_kra:0-2000]]__
Head, how do we speak to the serpent?__
*102845*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s010_020_mmr:80-3400]]__
There’s a horn on a platform at the middle point of the bridge. Take me to it.__
*102846*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s010_030_son:26-1497]]__
Finally! That horn!__
*102847*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s020_010_mmr:0-1750]]__
Good. Now put my lips to the horn.__
*102848*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s030_010_mmr:0-1250]]__
Listen closely now…__
*102849*__
[[S:::2030-4849]]__
We need two things to get us into the land of the Giants.__
*102850*__
[[S:::5139-9156]]__
First, we need to learn the travel rune that opens realm travel to Jötunheim.__
*102851*__
[[S:::9476-12843]]__
Second, we need to carve that rune into the special gateway.__
*102852*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s030_040_son:12-1700]]__
That one on the peak where we first met you?__
*102853*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s030_050_mmr:0-530]]__
Correct.__
*102854*__
[[S:::1140-6150]]__
Except the Giants, in their infinite wisdom, saw to it that no ordinary chisel would do the job.__
*102855*__
[[S:::6480-9080]]__
Only the tip of a magical chisel opens that gate.__
*102856*__
[[S:::9540-10850]]__
Luckily, I know where it is__
*102857*__
[[S:::11370-12250]]__
and it’s not far.__
*102858*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s030_011_son:100-1660]]__
He looked kinda mad for a moment there.__
*102859*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s030_012_mmr:110-681]]__
Ah. That.__
*102860*__
[[S:::982-2960]]__
He thought I said you were friends of Odin.__
*102861*__
[[S:::3300-4057]]__
You’ll forgive me—__
*102862*__
[[S:::4254-6473]]__
I’ve never spoken the Ancient Tongue sober.__
*102863*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s030_012_mmr_a:110-707]]__
Ah. That.__
*102864*__
[[S:::970-2966]]__
He thought I said you were friends of Odin.__
*102865*__
[[S:::3266-3972]]__
You’ll forgive me—__
*102866*__
[[S:::4398-6576]]__
I’ve never spoken the Ancient Tongue sober.__
*102867*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s030_013_son:160-940]]__
Wait, look!__
*102868*__
[[S:::1790-3230]]__
The water’s dropped even further!__
*102869*__
[[S:::3600-5655]]__
You can see more of the realm towers and statues.__
*102870*__
[[S:::6203-8272]]__
I even see new places to explore along the shore.__
*102871*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s030_020_kra:50-1250]]__
Where is this chisel?__
*102872*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s030_030_mmr:70-2026]]__
Find me a boat and we’ll go from there.__
*102873*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s040_010_son:150-1365]]__
So when we get to the boat,__
*102874*__
[[S:::1970-3912]]__
we can either look for that special chisel now,__
*102875*__
[[S:::4387-5707]]__
or go exploring for a little while.__
*102876*__
[[S:::6314-7597]]__
I’m happy with whatever you wanna do...__
*102877*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s040_020_kra:0-1000]]__
So there are…__
*102878*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s050_010_son:0-1250]]__
What’s hiding behind there?__
*102879*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s050_020_mmr:100-5340]]__
No earthly key nor physical force can get past the magic of that lock. Don’t even look at it.__
*102880*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_010_son:40-1500]]__
Never seen a lock like that before.__
*102881*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_020_mmr:170-2280]]__
Reminds me of something I’d seen Týr sketch.__
*102882*__
[[S:::2690-5680]]__
He liked to combine various symbols into runes all his own.__
*102883*__
[[S:::6200-7500]]__
This one, I believe, means—__
*102884*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_030_son:50-1380]]__
Peace. Unity.__
*102885*__
[[S:::1730-2330]]__
Mercy…__
*102886*__
[[S:::2890-3790]]__
other things too—__
*102887*__
[[S:::4580-6720]]__
I see what he did. But how do we get inside?__
*102888*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_040_kra:0-1250]]__
We have other concerns.__
*102889*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_050_son:100-2085]]__
This must be the door that was in Týr’s Triptych!__
*102890*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_060_mmr:140-2750]]__
I think you’re right. But we still need the key.__
*102891*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_070_kra:0-840]]__
Back to the Dwarf.__
*102892*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_080_son:23-1519]]__
We’re not gettin’ in there without a key.__
*102893*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_090_son:22-714]]__
OPEN UP!!__
*102894*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_100_son:0-750]]__
I really want in.__
*102895*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_110_mmr:160-1500]]__
Without a key? Wouldn’t bother.__
*102896*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_120_mmr:90-2250]]__
Eats away at you, doesn’t it? Locked doors.__
*102897*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_130_kra:0-640]]__
Týr’s rune.__
*102898*__
[[S:::1440-2000]]__
This is it.__
*102899*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s060_010_kra:50-1250]]__
Which way to the chisel?__
*102900*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s060_020_mmr:140-3600]]__
Keep rowing towards the statues of the oarsmen, then thread past between them.__
*102901*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s060_030_kra:0-1000]]__
Which way to the chisel?__
*102902*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s060_040_mmr:150-5250]]__
Boat under the bridge, keep rowing towards the statues of the oarsmen, then thread past between them.__
*102903*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s070_01_kra:0-1399]]__
This chisel we seek—what is it?__
*102904*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s070_020_mmr:55-5659]]__
Oh, and I guess we’re talking about the chisel now! Okay! I have just the story for you… [Clears__

throat.]__
*102906*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s070_030_kra:60-1290]]__
This chisel we seek—__
*102907*__
[[S:::1750-2420]]__
what is it?__
*102908*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s070_00_mmr:0-1630]]__
I’m glad you asked actually.__
*102909*__
[[S:::2270-4750]]__
I have just the story for you… (Clears throat)__
*102910*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s070_010_kra:130-1200]]__
This chisel we seek—__
*102911*__
[[S:::1570-2160]]__
what is it?__
*102912*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s070_040_mmr:92-4201]]__
I’m glad you asked actually. I have just the story for you… (clears throat)__
*102913*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s080_010_mmr:310-3022]]__
There was a Giant once named Thamur—__
*102914*__
[[S:::3390-5823]]__
a very giant Giant—__
*102915*__
[[S:::6260-12754]]__
who, despite his mountainous size, was without question the greatest stonemason this world had ever seen.__
*102916*__
[[S:::13450-17878]]__
Proud Thamur hoped to one day pass his vast knowledge on to his son,__
*102917*__
[[S:::18480-21598]]__
but young Hrimthur had the heart of a warrior.__
*102918*__
[[S:::22220-24369]]__
Perhaps the father had too much fear in him,__
*102919*__
[[S:::24740-26009]]__
or the son too little…__
*102920*__
[[S:::26420-30174]]__
either way, a quarrel of theirs spiraled out of control,__
*102921*__
[[S:::30314-34238]]__
and the overworked stone mason—bonk!—struck his son.__
*102922*__
[[S:::34819-36700]]__
Hrimthur ran off into the night.__
*102923*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s080_020_son:109-1892]]__
And?!? What happened next?__
*102924*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s080_011_mmr:0-3710]]__
Feeling shame and regret, Thamur chased after his son,__
*102925*__
[[S:::4200-9591]]__
but in his emotional state, soon found himself wandering Midgard, lost and alone.__
*102926*__
[[S:::10320-11078]]__
Sadly,__
*102927*__
[[S:::11390-16082]]__
he caught the eye of the one person he didn’t want to meet alone at night,__
*102928*__
[[S:::16380-17962]]__
so far from home…__
*102929*__
[[S:::18980-20142]]__
Thor.__
*102930*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s080_030_mmr:130-1117]]__
You’ll see.__
*102931*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_001_son:125-1820]]__
Okay, I know I saw something.__
*102932*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_002_kra:88-1095]]__
I saw it too.__
*102933*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_003_son:224-2920]]__
Freya did say the Jötunheim realm tower was missing from the lake.__
*102934*__
[[S:::3712-4750]]__
But maybe only kinda?__
*102935*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_004_mmr:133-2093]]__
Very strange indeed…__
*102936*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_005_son:147-3535]]__
There it was again! It’s there and then it’s not. What does it mean?__
*102937*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_010_son:70-1680]]__
This is where the tower to Jötunheim should be.__
*102938*__
[[S:::2640-3220]]__
Feels…__
*102939*__
[[S:::3570-4500]]__
strange, somehow.__
*102940*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_020_mmr:140-2790]]__
No doubt some arcane magics were involved.__
*102941*__
[[S:::3180-6500]]__
I would be not at all surprised to learn you were sensitive to that.__
*102942*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_030_son:42-1904]]__
That is where the Jötunheim tower used to be.__
*102943*__
[[S:::2618-5200]]__
The Witch said it has been gone for a hundred and fifty winters.__
*102944*__
[[S:::6686-9424]]__
I wonder what kind of magic could make a whole tower disappear.__
*102945*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_040_son:45-3499]]__
I can’t believe no one has found the Jötunheim tower after so many years.__
*102946*__
[[S:::4328-5867]]__
Where would you hide something that big?__
*102947*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_050_son:0-500]]__
Was that…__
*102948*__
[[S:::1240-1810]]__
the tower?__
*102949*__
[[S:::2810-3310]]__
Or,__
*102950*__
[[S:::3570-5340]]__
like a ghost of it, or something?__
*102951*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_060_son:25-5548]]__
There it is again. I swear it looks like the Jötunheim tower… but… only for second.__
*102952*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_070_son:51-991]]__
There it is again.__
*102953*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_080_son:36-1049]]__
What do you think it is?__
*102954*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s075_010_mmr:0-950]]__
Ah, good!__
*102955*__
[[S:::1300-3500]]__
The special chisel is ahead, past this gate.__
*102956*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_010_son:0-710]]__
So, Mimir…__
*102957*__
[[S:::1910-3250]]__
why did Freya spit in your face?__
*102958*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_020_kra:30-590]]__
No,__
*102959*__
[[S:::1160-2160]]__
speak of Baldur.__
*102960*__
[[S:::2690-4250]]__
He claims nothing harms him.__
*102961*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_030_mmr:120-4430]]__
Aye, Baldur is blessed with invulnerability to all threats, physical or magical.__
*102962*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_040_kra:60-1150]]__
The boasting of a god.__
*102963*__
[[S:::1710-2750]]__
Everyone has a weakness.__
*102964*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_050_mmr:150-5866]]__
Not him, I’m afraid. Baldur is blessed with invulnerability to all threats, physical or magical.__
*102965*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_060_son:30-1229]]__
You just said that, Mimir.__
*102966*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_070_mmr:150-650]]__
Did I?__
*102967*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_080_kra:20-1240]]__
What is the source of this power?__
*102968*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_090_mmr:130-2800]]__
Well, as I recall… it involved… eh…__
*102969*__
[[S:::3560-4250]]__
a spell…?__
*102970*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_100_son:38-738]]__
Mimir?__
*102971*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_110_mmr:210-2710]]__
Parts of m’brain must still be coming back to life.__
*102972*__
[[S:::3200-5250]]__
Just need a moment to finish waking up.__
*102973*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_120_son:110-1250]]__
Hope he’s not broken…__
*102974*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s090_010_son:8-3554]]__
So to get to the mountain, we have to go through Vanaheim, right?__
*102975*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s090_020_mmr:7-4522]]__
No, no, NO—that’s not Vanaheim, that’s the Vanaheim Tower,__
*102976*__
[[S:::4522-6865]]__
and both sides of it are still in Midgard.__
*102977*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s090_030_son:0-510]]__
Oh yeah?__
*102978*__
[[S:::1260-4493]]__
Then why is the bridge always pointing to Vanaheim when we come back to Midgard?__
*102979*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s090_040_mmr:0-1180]]__
Look, would you rather it didn’t?__
*102980*__
[[S:::1600-5300]]__
Does your life want for lack of time spent bridge-pushing? No?__
*102981*__
[[S:::5790-6582]]__
All right then.__
*102982*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s090_050_son:13-4320]]__
So let me get this straight—we’re not in Vanaheim right now__
*102983*__
[[S:::4320-6593]]__
even though we’re walking through the Vanaheim Tower?__
*102984*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s090_060_mmr:0-2450]]__
Correct. We’re still in Midgard.__
*102985*__
[[S:::2820-8230]]__
This tower is just a mirror of an identical tower in Vanaheim that exists in this same spot.__
*102986*__
[[S:::8740-10660]]__
Here in Midgard, it’s just symbolic.__
*102987*__
[[S:::11080-14250]]__
We would need to use the Realm Travel Room to get to Vanaheim.__
*102988*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s090_070_son:6-830]]__
Confused.__
*102989*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s090_080_mmr:60-1500]]__
Be grateful it works at all.__
*102990*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl06_s340_010_son_stem:27050-28000]]__
Why’s he doing that?__
*102991*__
[[S:::39910-40400]]__
But…__
*102992*__
[[S:::41121-42069]]__
doesn’t that hurt?__
*102993*__
[[S:::142050-142872]]__
What is he doing?__
*102994*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl06_s340_010_mmr_stem:28730-31770]]__
Odin had that statue made in honor of Thor.__
*102995*__
[[S:::32520-39298]]__
And seeing as the World Serpent absolutely abhors the fat dobber, he was probably sick of looking at it.__
*102996*__
[[S:::42430-46380]]__
Well, he and Thor have a bit of an unpleasant history between them…__
*102997*__
[[S:::46760-47800]]__
or they will, anyway.__
*102998*__
[[S:::48420-54030]]__
So I guess waking up to see it was worse than the thought of lumps of solid stone passing through his gullet.__
*102999*__
[[S:::54680-55580]]__
You want me to ask him?__
*103000*__
[[S:::67510-69270]]__
All right, wish me luck!__
*103001*__
[[S:::70127-73224]]__
Aaaaaaah-woooooo-(coughs)__
*103002*__
[[S:::74004-79985]]__
Yooooooor-moooooooo hin meeee-meeeeeeeeer.__
*103003*__
[[S:::86120-89089]]__
I’ve still got it, lads. He remembers me.__
*103004*__
[[S:::89562-91328]]__
Lyoooooooooo—__
*103005*__
[[S:::91530-93174]]__
Oh no! That’s not it! Uh…__
*103006*__
[[S:::93599-99873]]__
Maaaaaw-lon-gooooo vih-nooooor kooooon tooooon kooooon.__
*103007*__
[[S:::101334-103577]]__
Ahh… Oh, dear. Eh…__
*103008*__
[[S:::103773-110344]]__
Ehhhhhh-kooooo… noooooh oh-thooooo voo-nooooor…__
*103009*__
[[S:::119143-120777]]__
He knows the pain of your loss.__
*103010*__
[[S:::121328-122238]]__
He will help you.__
*103011*__
[[S:::130611-134285]]__
Efni… ooooo-fooooon-goooor.__
*103012*__
[[S:::135000-135900]]__
Curious…__
*103013*__
[[S:::137597-139783]]__
Ohhh… Nothing to be concerned about.__
*103014*__
[[S:::142900-144800]]__
Making sure we’re heading in the right direction.__
*103015*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl06_s340_010_kra_stem:55910-56440]]__
No.__
*103016*__
[[S:::57080-58730]]__
Our only concern is Jötunheim.__
*103017*__
[[S:::136260-136750]]__
What is it?__
*103018*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl06_s365_010_kra_stem:790-1590]]__
Atreus…__
*103019*__
[[S:::6630-8040]]__
I know how to read, boy.__
*103020*__
[[S:::8630-9590]]__
Just not this tongue.__
*103021*__
[[S:::18850-19450]]__
Wait.__
*103022*__
[[S:::22150-22922]]__
Not that.__
*103023*__
[[S:::24380-25470]]__
Do you smell something?__
*103024*__
[[S:::54550-55650]]__
Arrrgh!__
*103025*__
[[S:::62750-66000]]__
ARRRGH!__
*103026*__
[[S:::111800-113100]]__
RAAAAAAAA!!!__
*103027*__
[[S:::146000-147000]]__
Atreus…__
*103028*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl06_s365_010_son_stem:2050-6210]]__
Come on. You already speak it. Learning to read won’t be that hard.__
*103029*__
[[S:::10440-15410]]__
You’re halfway there already then. Okay… so the runes represent a lot of different things.__
*103030*__
[[S:::15800-18850]]__
Some gods, some animals, and some are—__
*103031*__
[[S:::20003-22150]]__
Oh, am I going too fast? Sorry I’ll—__
*103032*__
[[S:::29500-32270]]__
Yeah, I do. Smells like—__
*103033*__
[[S:::35040-35580]]__
rain?__
*103034*__
[[S:::58650-59550]]__
No!__
*103035*__
[[S:::61640-62620]]__
Þruma—!!__
*103036*__
[[S:::73000-74500]]__
Shut up!__
*103037*__
[[S:::80530-84530]]__
You don’t… know anything… about my mother.__
*103038*__
[[S:::94800-96130]]__
STOP IT!__
*103039*__
[[S:::98000-99700]]__
RAAAAAAAA—!!!__
*103040*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl06_s365_010_mdi_stem:41710-43110]]__
You ruined everything.__
*103041*__
[[S:::43860-45320]]__
I earned that fucking hammer,__
*103042*__
[[S:::46170-51160]]__
but now everyone’s gonna think I only got it ‘cause Magni’s gone.__
*103043*__
[[S:::51230-52880]]__
I’ll be a joke.__
*103044*__
[[S:::53900-55250]]__
But if I kill you—__
*103045*__
[[S:::56250-58000]]__
—no one’s gonna laugh at me.__
*103046*__
[[S:::66510-67290]]__
Wow, are you dumb.__
*103047*__
[[S:::68040-73350]]__
That your father’s doing or did you get it from your mom? She stupid and ugly?__
*103048*__
[[S:::84530-91760]]__
Oh that's true. But I’m gonna get to know you really well. You’re gonna be my new brother.__
*103049*__
[[S:::92130-94810]]__
...right after I finish killing your father.__
*103050*__
[[S:::101750-104440]]__
Whoops... I think I broke him.__
*103051*__
[[S:::115210-116330]]__
Stay back!__
*103052*__
[[S:::132610-133280]]__
No…__
*103053*__
[[S:::136889-138780]]__
This isn’t over!__
*103054*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl06_s365_010_mmr_stem:143480-144480]]__
Brother… the boy.__
*103055*__
[[S:::150020-152500]]__
You have to get him to Freya quickly! There’s no other way.__
*103056*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_010_mmr:0-900]]__
What now then?__
*103057*__
[[S:::1350-3235]]__
Maybe Freya ought to have a look at the boy.__
*103058*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_020_kra:0-600]]__
Unnecessary.__
*103059*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_030_son:0-1510]]__
No, I feel better now.__
*103060*__
[[S:::1730-3150]]__
I just needed to catch my breath.__
*103061*__
[[S:::3740-4600]]__
Where do we go next?__
*103062*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_040_mmr:0-2347]]__
Well, now that we’ve got the Giant’s chisel,__
*103063*__
[[S:::2447-4562]]__
we need to learn the travel rune to Jötunheim__
*103064*__
[[S:::4653-7559]]__
so we can carve it into that special gateway atop the peak,__
*103065*__
[[S:::7649-10148]]__
and open realm travel to the land of the Giants.__
*103066*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_050_son:0-803]]__
You don’t know it?__
*103067*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_060_mmr:520-1632]]__
Alas, no—__
*103068*__
[[S:::1900-6000]]__
but the Serpent did mention that the Giants had entrusted that secret to Týr.__
*103069*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_070_son:28-889]]__
Isn’t Týr dead?__
*103070*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_080_mmr:0-1380]]__
Long gone, it’s true.__
*103071*__
[[S:::1990-6630]]__
But his hidden vault—where he kept his most prized possessions and secrets—still exists,__
*103072*__
[[S:::6940-10500]]__
undisturbed and hidden underwater for a hundred and forty-odd winters.__
*103073*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_090_son:0-500]]__
His temple?__
*103074*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_100_mmr:20-3791]]__
Aye, but his hidden vault is very much in reach.__
*103075*__
[[S:::4063-5712]]__
The doors are beneath his temple,__
*103076*__
[[S:::5852-10329]]__
submerged in the lake for generations until our snake-friend shifted his weight.__
*103077*__
[[S:::10622-14252]]__
There we shall find the fabled “Black Rune of Jötunheim”…__
*103078*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_100_mmr_a:110-3823]]__
Aye, but his hidden vault is very much in reach.__
*103079*__
[[S:::4023-5747]]__
The doors are beneath his temple,__
*103080*__
[[S:::5863-10314]]__
submerged in the lake for generations until our snake-friend shifted his weight.__
*103081*__
[[S:::10642-14300]]__
There we shall find the fabled “Black Rune of Jötunheim”…__
*103082*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_110_son:174-1499]]__
We could also explore some more.__
*103083*__
[[S:::2054-3135]]__
We got that chisel now,__
*103084*__
[[S:::3492-4914]]__
and that vault isn't going anywhere.__
*103085*__
[[S:::5301-6811]]__
Seems a shame to waste a boat...__
*103086*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_120_kra:20-1180]]__
We shall see, boy.__
*103087*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s020_010_son:75-2612]]__
Oooh… Týr’s vault is behind that magical lock!__
*103088*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s020_020_son:30-560]]__
Oooh…__
*103089*__
[[S:::1000-3600]]__
I bet Týr’s vault is behind that magical lock we saw earlier!__
*103090*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s020_030_mmr:160-2300]]__
That’s right, lad. It’s on the other side of the bridge.__
*103091*__
[[S:::2710-5000]]__
Head across, then take the stairs all the way down.__
*103092*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl06_s020_040_kra:34-2481]]__
Head—the entrance to the hidden vault.__
*103093*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s020_050_mmr:133-3951]]__
It’s on the other side of the bridge. Head across, then take the stairs all the way down.__
*103094*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s030_010_mmr:170-3091]]__
The entrance to Týr’s vault is at the bottom of these stairs—__
*103095*__
[[S:::3217-5955]]__
whenever you decide it’s time to go after the Black Rune, yeah?__
*103096*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s040_010_mmr:80-4250]]__
Týr’s vault is at the bottom of those stairs—just take them all the way to the bottom.__
*103097*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s050_010_mmr:0-1250]]__
Brother—the chisel…__
*103098*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s060_010_son:50-670]]__
Wow.__
*103099*__
[[S:::1125-3124]]__
I can’t believe we’re setting foot in Týr’s vault!__
*103100*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s070_010_son:60-1250]]__
Another shrine to a Giant—but it’s got a panel missing!__
*103101*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s080_010_son:70-1232]]__
It’s Týr! But…__
*103102*__
[[S:::1650-2955]]__
the middle panel is missing.__
*103103*__
[[S:::3360-6146]]__
Wait, I thought Týr was a god, not a Giant.__
*103104*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s080_020_mmr:60-3437]]__
Aye. But he was loved by everyone, including the Giants.__
*103105*__
[[S:::3870-7587]]__
Other than me, he was the only one they gifted with their special sight.__
*103106*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s080_030_mmr:0-3581]]__
Hey… I wonder if the Giants left a triptych about me somewhere too?__
*103107*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl06_s090_010_kra:28-653]]__
Go ahead.__
*103108*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s090_020_son:80-1430]]__
Actually… come look.__
*103109*__
[[S:::1920-3160]]__
Let me show you how to read this.__
*103110*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl06_s090_030_kra:0-1000]]__
That is not necess—__
*103111*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s090_040_son:0-1400]]__
You’ve taught me so much.__
*103112*__
[[S:::1810-3000]]__
Let me teach you something.__
*103113*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s090_050_son:44-2893]]__
What if you need to use one and I’m not there? This’ll be fun!__
*103114*__
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_010_mdi:0-3680]]__
Grandfather has much to discuss with your boy.__
*103115*__
[[S:::4670-6500]]__
It won’t be pleasant.__
*103116*__
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_020_mdi:18-3429]]__
Don’t worry. I’ll keep an eye on him.__
*103117*__
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_030_mdi:65-2121]]__
Stay down! It’s over.__
*103118*__
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_040_mdi:40-1750]]__
Just die already!__
*103119*__
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_050_mdi:47-1303]]__
Impossible!__
*103120*__
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_060_mdi:32-1092]]__
Don’t come any closer!__
*103121*__
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_070_mdi:60-1250]]__
Fall, damn you!__
*103122*__
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_080_mdi:49-1833]]__
Why won’t you die!?__
*103123*__
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_090_mdi:0-950]]__
I thought so.__
*103124*__
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_100_mdi:0-1960]]__
And then there was one…__
*103125*__
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_110_mdi:50-4500]]__
The halls of Asgard will sing with my name!__
*103126*__
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_120_mdi:170-3050]]__
I’ve avenged you, brother!__
*103127*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl06_s110_010_kra:19-597]]__
Atreus…__
*103128*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s110_020_mmr:30-2750]]__
You have to get him to Freya, quickly. There’s no other way.__
*103129*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s120_010_mmr:52-2131]]__
Take the boat. Freya’s isn’t far.__
*103130*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl06_s130_010_kra:220-1250]]__
I need to help my son.__
*103131*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl06_s130_020_kra:43-1318]]__
I need to help Atreus.__
*103132*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl06_s130_030_kra:56-1233]]__
I must go to Freya.__
*103133*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s140_010_mmr:110-4270]]__
Odin’s eye is on you, brother. Especially now that you’ve taken to killing his kin.__
*103134*__
[[S:::5040-8880]]__
Freya’s forest is a blind spot for him. This is our smartest move.__
*103135*__
[[S:::9390-10710]]__
And if anyone can heal him,__
*103136*__
[[S:::11170-11680]]__
it’s her.__
*103137*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl06_s140_020_kra:0-1250]]__
What is happening to him?__
*103138*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s140_030_mmr:70-5010]]__
I’ve seen it in mortals, that some conflict of the mind expresses itself as an ailment of the body.__
*103139*__
[[S:::5530-6700]]__
Never in a God,__
*103140*__
[[S:::7280-9990]]__
but… a God believing himself mortal?__
*103141*__
[[S:::10590-11750]]__
I can only imagine…__
*103142*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s140_040_mmr:66-1122]]__
We’re almost there.__
*103144*__
[[S::vo_lvl_clrv_s430_010_kra_stem:5060-5880]]__
Boy.__
*103145*__
[[S:::8850-9450]]__
Here.__
*103146*__
[[S:::14320-15758]]__
On the day you were born,__
*103147*__
[[S:::16460-17770]]__
I made two knives,__
*103148*__
[[S:::18600-21477]]__
mixing metals from my home and from this land.__
*103149*__
[[S:::22770-23936]]__
One for myself,__
*103150*__
[[S:::25020-26445]]__
and when you were ready,__
*103151*__
[[S:::27160-28303]]__
one for you.__
*103152*__
[[S:::29560-31119]]__
Today is that day.__
*103153*__
[[S:::39230-40217]]__
No.__
*103154*__
[[S:::41530-42961]]__
We are not men.__
*103155*__
[[S:::44000-45509]]__
We are more than that.__
*103156*__
[[S:::46050-48527]]__
The responsibility is far greater.__
*103157*__
[[S:::51906-57465]]__
And you must be better than me. Understand?__
*103158*__
[[S:::59628-60928]]__
Say it.__
*103159*__
[[S:::67628-72929]]__
The power of this weapon, any weapon, comes from here…__
*103160*__
[[S:::73998-75993]]__
… but only when tempered by this.__
*103161*__
[[S:::77019-80984]]__
By the discipline, the self-control, of the one who wields it.__
*103162*__
[[S:::81807-84872]]__
That is where the true strength of a warrior lies.__
*103163*__
[[S:::86570-88398]]__
You must never forget that.__
*103164*__
[[S:::92957-96191]]__
Good then. Come.__
*103165*__
[[S:::114315-115252]]__
Blank.__
*103166*__
[[S:::128753-130439]]__
The rune! Did you see it?!__
*103167*__
[[S:::131596-132525]]__
Are you certain?__
*103168*__
[[S:::134682-137066]]__
Good then. Aim for the face!__
*103169*__
[[S::vo_lvl_clrv_s430_010_son_stem:36860-37992]]__
So I’m a man now,__
*103170*__
[[S:::38580-39230]]__
like you.__
*103171*__
[[S:::62120-63494]]__
I will be better.__
*103172*__
[[S:::103240-104327]]__
Dreifa.__
*103173*__
[[S:::119380-120164]]__
Wait…__
*103174*__
[[S:::130910-131596]]__
Yes!__
*103175*__
[[S:::132602-134407]]__
I got it. Trust me.__
*103176*__
[[S::vo_lvl_clrv_s425_010_son_stem:7030-8300]]__
Wow.__
*103177*__
[[S:::13600-14470]]__
Look at that!__
*103178*__
[[S:::78680-79580]]__
What’d you find—?__
*103179*__
[[S:::89220-90020]]__
Okay…__
*103180*__
[[S::vo_lvl_clrv_s425_010_kra_stem:82170-83100]]__
Enough distraction.__
*103181*__
[[S:::84300-85750]]__
Do not forget why we are here.__
*103182*__
[[S::vo_lvl_clrv_s440_010_kra_stem:21500-22000]]__
Sit.__
*103183*__
[[S:::32050-32820]]__
Lemnian wine.__
*103184*__
[[S:::33540-34970]]__
From the island of Lemnos,__
*103185*__
[[S:::35740-37570]]__
near the place of my birth.__
*103186*__
[[S:::55030-56090]]__
To a journey’s end.__
*103187*__
[[S:::67390-67890]]__
Possibly.__
*103188*__
[[S:::88780-90410]]__
Aaaah…__
*103189*__
[[S:::139980-140660]]__
Yes.__
*103190*__
[[S:::156090-156590]]__
Ready?__
*103191*__
[[S:::159960-160460]]__
Come.__
*103192*__
[[S::vo_lvl_clrv_s440_010_son_stem:0-890]]__
Jörð…__
*103193*__
[[S:::18590-20090]]__
We’re so close to the end…__
*103194*__
[[S:::48460-50700]]__
“Lemnos”…__
*103195*__
[[S:::58620-59210]]__
Really?__
*103196*__
[[S:::63180-66670]]__
Smells like rotten eggs. Is it still good?__
*103197*__
[[S:::91740-93580]]__
Aaaah…__
*103198*__
[[S:::112890-116420]]__
Father? Why did you leave your home and come here?__
*103199*__
[[S:::118480-119800]]__
Does it have to do with the other gods there?__
*103200*__
[[S:::123870-127290]]__
It’s just… you hate the gods so much.__
*103201*__
[[S:::128290-131810]]__
But Týr proves that gods can be good. And you’re good.__
*103202*__
[[S:::132920-134740]]__
You only killed those deserving, right?__
*103203*__
[[S:::144430-147320]]__
Quiet, Head. We are. We know better.__
*103204*__
[[S:::157470-157970]]__
Ready.__
*103205*__
[[S:::164210-165810]]__
I think I’m going to like being a god…__
*103206*__
[[S::vo_lvl_clrv_s440_010_mmr_stem:140980-141500]]__
Ah,__
*103207*__
[[S:::141830-144390]]__
but who’s worthy enough to judge?__
*103208*__
[[S:::148390-148830]]__
Huh.__
*103209*__
[[S:::149580-151750]]__
Sounding more like your da’ by the moment.__
*103210*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s010_010_son:0-240]]__
Wow.__
*103211*__
[[S:::820-3250]]__
I can’t believe we’re setting foot in Týr’s vault!__
*103212*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s020_010_son:0-590]]__
It’s Týr!__
*103213*__
[[S:::1200-1450]]__
But…__
*103214*__
[[S:::1800-3120]]__
the middle panel is missing.__
*103215*__
[[S:::3730-6750]]__
Wait, I thought Týr was a god, not a Giant.__
*103216*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s020_020_mmr:0-70]]__
Aye.__
*103217*__
[[S:::760-3630]]__
But he was loved by everyone, including the Giants.__
*103218*__
[[S:::4310-7750]]__
Other than me, he was the only one they gifted with their special sight.__
*103219*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s020_030_mmr:0-3750]]__
Hey… I wonder if the Giants left a triptych about me somewhere too?__
*103220*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s025_010_kra:0-200]]__
Go,__
*103221*__
[[S:::560-1749]]__
read from the sand bowl.__
*103222*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s025_020_son:110-1480]]__
“Death itself I swallow...__
*103223*__
[[S:::2240-3750]]__
To spring forth life tomorrow.“__
*103224*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrv_s025_030_mmr:0-270]]__
Oh…__
*103225*__
[[S:::870-1700]]__
I like that one.__
*103226*__
[[S:::2310-3710]]__
I wonder if I wrote it…__
*103227*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s025_040_kra:0-1220]]__
Is that the answer there?__
*103228*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s025_050_son:49-1458]]__
It says “Earth.”__
*103229*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s025_050_son_a:75-1641]]__
It says “Earth.”__
*103230*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s025_050_son_b:75-1924]]__
It says “Earth.”__
*103231*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s025_060_kra:0-400]]__
Proceed.__
*103232*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s025_070_son:5-468]]__
Jörð…__
*103233*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_001_son:37-4774]]__
I wish I’d known I was a god in Alfheim… I wouldn’t have felt so bad about killing so many Elves.__
*103234*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_002_mmr:0-2250]]__
Well, I’m not sure that’s the lesson…__
*103235*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_003_kra:150-1610]]__
You’ve done nothing to regret.__
*103236*__
[[S:::1960-4000]]__
The Elves forced their affairs upon us.__
*103237*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_004_son:30-1020]]__
No, I get it now.__
*103238*__
[[S:::1520-2810]]__
We had god things to do,__
*103239*__
[[S:::3250-4090]]__
and they were in the way,__
*103240*__
[[S:::4600-6250]]__
dragging us into their little problems.__
*103241*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_005_mmr:0-2000]]__
Again, are we just leaving that there…?__
*103242*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_006_son:190-650]]__
I mean,__
*103243*__
[[S:::880-3150]]__
just knowing we’re gods makes me feel so much…__
*103244*__
[[S:::3510-4000]]__
stronger.__
*103245*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_006_mmr:50-500]]__
Eh…__
*103246*__
[[S:::880-2500]]__
laddy, up on the wall there__
*103247*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_007_mmr:0-2244]]__
Maybe you feel a little too good right now.__
*103248*__
[[S:::2530-4699]]__
With power comes a big choice, lad.__
*103249*__
[[S:::4918-9838]]__
You can either serve yourself or put your godhood in the service of others. Like Týr did.__
*103250*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_010_son:0-1000]]__
People really loved him, huh?__
*103251*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_020_mmr:30-2230]]__
Aye. A god of war...__
*103252*__
[[S:::2610-4180]]__
but one who fought for peace.__
*103253*__
[[S:::4950-7670]]__
Had a reputation for being heroic and lawful,__
*103254*__
[[S:::8120-11910]]__
using his power and knowledge to stop wars, rather than start them.__
*103255*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_030_son:0-1250]]__
So there are good gods…__
*103256*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_040_mmr:120-2250]]__
Once in a moon, it’s been known to happen, yes.__
*103257*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_050_son:160-4300]]__
This one mentions places I’ve never even heard of. Seems Týr really liked to travel.__
*103258*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_060_mmr:50-4688]]__
Týr believed the mind, not might was key to preventing war and chaos.__
*103259*__
[[S:::4714-9630]]__
And he also knew visiting other cultures would give him perspective staying in one place could not.__
*103260*__
[[S:::10210-13580]]__
While Odin always hoarded knowledge, guarding it jealously,__
*103261*__
[[S:::14050-17040]]__
Týr was open and sharing with his learning and his wisdom.__
*103262*__
[[S:::17660-19660]]__
For this, mortals adored Týr—__
*103263*__
[[S:::20200-22920]]__
showing their love by bringing him gifts the world over.__
*103264*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_070_son:20-1860]]__
So what ever happened to Týr?__
*103265*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_080_mmr:0-2530]]__
Odin came to regard him as a threat to his rule…__
*103266*__
[[S:::2930-8460]]__
he suspected Týr of collaborating to aid the Giants instead of helping to steal their secrets for the Aesir.__
*103267*__
[[S:::8960-10750]]__
Same thing he accused me of, frankly --__
*103268*__
[[S:::11260-13250]]__
though in Týr’s case, I believe he was right.__
*103269*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_090_son:20-1500]]__
You think Týr was helping the Giants?__
*103270*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_090_son_a:43-1604]]__
So, what happened to this temple?__
*103271*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_100_mmr:0-550]]__
I do.__
*103272*__
[[S:::1090-4230]]__
He felt responsible for the suffering visited upon them by Odin.__
*103273*__
[[S:::4660-8000]]__
I suspect he had something to do with helping them cover their tracks.__
*103274*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_110_son:88-1410]]__
The missing Jötunheim tower!__
*103275*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_120_mmr:30-890]]__
Correct.__
*103276*__
[[S:::1240-4300]]__
Whatever happened to it, I believe it could only have been done__
*103277*__
[[S:::4300-6250]]__
with Týr and the Giants working together.__
*103278*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s040_010_kra:60-2000]]__
Where is this Black Rune, Head?__
*103279*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s040_020_mmr:40-1850]]__
Don’t know. I’ve never been in here.__
*103280*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s050_010_son:1-1860]]__
The stone! That has to be it!__
*103281*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s050_020_son:14-2068]]__
Naturally.__
*103282*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s050_030_mmr:27-1662]]__
Didn’t think it would be that easy?__
*103283*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s050_040_son:48-583]]__
No.__
*103284*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s050_040_son_a:140-700]]__
No.__
*103285*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s050_050_son:25-1206]]__
Was kind of hoping though…__
*103286*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s050_060_son:90-730]]__
So what now?__
*103287*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s060_010_son:49-2919]]__
That’s gonna come to life and try to kill us at some point, huh?__
*103288*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s060_020_kra:0-750]]__
Most likely.__
*103289*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s060_030_mmr:0-1870]]__
Our boy is catching on, isn’t he?__
*103290*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s070_010_mmr:0-2000]]__
Brother, up there—the Winds of Hel.__
*103291*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s070_020_son:33-982]]__
The winds of what?__
*103292*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s070_030_mmr:0-1230]]__
Oh… we forget to mention that?__
*103293*__
[[S:::1850-4250]]__
When you were sick, we went to Helheim to get your cure.__
*103294*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s070_040_son:54-937]]__
You did?__
*103295*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s070_050_mmr:0-1850]]__
Terrible experience, by the by.__
*103296*__
[[S:::2240-5250]]__
Your da’ picked up a new trick though… with a little help from Brok.__
*103297*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s070_060_son:140-1100]]__
Brok was there too!?!__
*103298*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s070_070_son:130-1150]]__
I… but…__
*103299*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s070_080_son:67-1996]]__
We’ll get back to this later.__
*103300*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s070_090_mmr:0-1920]]__
Brother… a trap for the Winds of Hel.__
*103301*__
[[S:::2300-3500]]__
But where do you think the Winds are?__
*103302*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrv_s075_010_mmr:0-1500]]__
Move it or you may lose it, brother.__
*103303*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s080_010_son:58-1335]]__
Well that’s unfriendly.__
*103304*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s090_010_son:50-1086]]__
How’d you know that was there?__
*103305*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s090_020_kra:19-841]]__
Experience.__
*103306*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s100_010_mmr:60-3500]]__
Look. Small passages on either side. Perfect for the boy.__
*103307*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s100_020_son:220-1500]]__
It’s too small for father though.__
*103308*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s100_030_kra:0-490]]__
Go.__
*103309*__
[[S:::860-1500]]__
I will be fine.__
*103310*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s100_040_son:70-380]]__
But—__
*103311*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s100_050_kra:15-465]]__
Go.__
*103312*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s110_010_mmr:30-3500]]__
Careful, brother. Freya’s not here to bring you back if you’re cut in two.__
*103313*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s110_020_kra:13-974]]__
Quiet, Head.__
*103314*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s120_010_son:64-802]]__
You made it!__
*103315*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s130_010_mmr:70-4000]]__
That’s from a great desert land very far from here.__
*103316*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s130_020_son:30-1010]]__
Do gods live there?__
*103317*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s130_030_mmr:0-2930]]__
Oh my, yes… many, many gods.__
*103318*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s130_040_son:40-710]]__
Good or bad?__
*103319*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s130_050_mmr:170-2240]]__
Not as simple as that, I’m afraid…__
*103320*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s130_050_mmr_a:0-2000]]__
Not as simple as that, I’m afraid…__
*103321*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s140_010_mmr:178-787]]__
Ah…__
*103322*__
[[S:::1030-3141]]__
a sgian-dubh from my homeland.__
*103323*__
[[S:::3756-5629]]__
Used to have one of my own back in the day.__
*103324*__
[[S:::6214-7152]]__
You should take it, boy!__
*103325*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s140_020_kra:0-1560]]__
Yes, boy… take it.__
*103326*__
[[S:::2010-4385]]__
We might need to butter bread somewhere on our travels.__
*103327*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s140_030_mmr:112-1666]]__
This is why no one likes you.__
*103328*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s140_030_mmr_a:139-2015]]__
This is why no one likes you.__
*103329*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s150_010_son:251-2150]]__
What did you see in the vault that set you off?__
*103330*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s150_020_kra:120-1139]]__
It is not important.__
*103331*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s150_030_son:21-1655]]__
Seemed important to you.__
*103332*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s150_040_kra:50-1396]]__
It was a rash impulse.__
*103333*__
[[S:::2110-4250]]__
You need not dwell on my failings.__
*103334*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s150_050_son:80-600]]__
Wow.__
*103335*__
[[S:::1100-2290]]__
That was almost an apology.__
*103336*__
[[S:::2820-4940]]__
Well, I guess you do like to smash pottery.__
*103337*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrv_s150_060_mmr:15-512]]__
Ha!__
*103338*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s155_010_mmr:0-4250]]__
Stands to reason the second ring should behave like the first. Just need to capture the Winds…__
*103339*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s160_010_son:48-7800]]__
Look, I just want the truth from now on, okay? I don’t care if it hurts me or not. I want to learn.__
*103340*__
[[S:::7800-10696]]__
Just ‘cause you hate being a god doesn’t mean I have to.__
*103341*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s170_010_mmr:0-1250]]__
More small passages.__
*103342*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s170_020_son:60-600]]__
I know…__
*103343*__
[[S:::1240-1700]]__
“go.”__
*103344*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s170_030_mmr:0-1840]]__
I can’t watch, brother. Good luck!__
*103345*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s180_010_son:1100-2480]]__
And I thought the saws were scary.__
*103346*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s180_020_son:98-3350]]__
Look! It’s the Wolf-Giants, Sköll and Hati!__
*103347*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s180_030_mmr:70-2500]]__
That’s right, “the bringers of day and night.”__
*103348*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s180_040_son:170-2310]]__
Ragnarök begins when they catch the sun and moon,__
*103349*__
[[S:::3000-3500]]__
right?__
*103350*__
[[S:::4350-5110]]__
Did Týr know them?__
*103351*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s180_050_mmr:59-4255]]__
I don’t know. Liked them well enough to cover a massive wall in his vault with them though.__
*103352*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s190_010_son:0-1657]]__
I don’t see another trap for the…__
*103353*__
[[S:::2144-2720]]__
uh...__
*103354*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s190_020_mmr:50-780]]__
“Winds of Hel?”__
*103355*__
[[S:::1330-4098]]__
Maybe we can get up to one of those balconies for a better look?__
*103356*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s200_010_son:45-2887]]__
Don’t you enjoy it at all? Being a god?__
*103357*__
[[S:::3879-5830]]__
Out on an adventure in some amazing place?__
*103358*__
[[S:::9755-11508]]__
Maybe mother wanted us to have a little fun.__
*103359*__
[[S:::13246-17269]]__
Everything we’ve seen and done… maybe it was her gift.__
*103360*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s210_010_son:69-1865]]__
Look! There’s the wind trap!__
*103361*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s220_010_son:42-1491]]__
I think we can get down here.__
*103362*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrv_s220_020_mmr:0-520]]__
Aye, but__
*103363*__
[[S:::1070-4000]]__
the winds of Hel will not endure long enough to cover that distance.__
*103364*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrv_s225_010_mmr:0-610]]__
Ahh—__
*103365*__
[[S:::1190-1750]]__
clever.__
*103366*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s230_010_son:109-597]]__
You know…__
*103367*__
[[S:::1120-3500]]__
for someone so loved, Týr sure was paranoid.__
*103368*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s230_020_mmr:97-3000]]__
Aye...Thanks to Odin—with good reason.__
*103369*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_010_son:19-2000]]__
The runestone—it’s lowering!__
*103370*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_020_kra:8-460]]__
ARRRGH!__
*103371*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_030_son:164-1002]]__
What’s going on?!?__
*103372*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_040_kra:24-563]]__
Trap…__
*103373*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_050_son:131-755]]__
Father!__
*103374*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_060_kra:0-510]]__
Boy!__
*103375*__
[[S:::870-1500]]__
Get out of here!__
*103376*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_070_son:220-2040]]__
I’m fine! How do we get you out?__
*103377*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_080_kra:40-1500]]__
Pull chains… on the wall.__
*103378*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_090_son:151-3096]]__
But… there are three of them! What do I do?!?!__
*103379*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_100_kra:0-2230]]__
Atreus… focus. You can do this.__
*103380*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_110_mmr:50-2450]]__
Please hurry! I don’t know yet if I can drown.__
*103381*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_120_son:90-5400]]__
Okay… think. Hati’s the silver one. He hunts the moon. Sköll’s gold and he chases the sun.__
*103382*__
[[S:::5400-8870]]__
For Ragnarök to happen, they have to eat them. But these are out of order.__
*103383*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_130_kra:0-600]]__
Good boy.__
*103384*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_140_son:260-4700]]__
So the moon goes on the left… sun on the right, with Midgard in the middle. But which bar do I pull?__
*103385*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_141_son:64-4140]]__
Gotta get them in order: Moon, left… sun, right… with Midgard in the middle.__
*103386*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_141_son_a:25-2827]]__
Moon on the left, sun on the right, Midgard in the middle.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_141_son_b:220-2470]]__
Moon, Midgard, Sun. Moon, Midgard, Sun.__

Moon, Midgard, Sun. Think!__

Boy! You have to stop that chain!__
*103424*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s250_040_son:100-732]]__
HOW!?!__
*103425*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s250_050_kra:0-500]]__
I…__
*103426*__
[[S:::980-2000]]__
I do not know!__
*103427*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s250_041_son:100-3300]]__
Uhhh…come on…come on, there’s got to be something I can…__
*103428*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s250_060_son:0-1100]]__
Wait! I know what to do!__
*103429*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s250_070_kra:43-599]]__
Her knife?__
*103430*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s250_080_son:54-1076]]__
There’s no other way!__
*103431*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s250_090_son:38-2642]]__
It’s not working! That should have worked!__
*103432*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s260_010_mmr:60-2850]]__
Well, I can’t drown. Guess that’s something.__
*103433*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s260_020_kra:50-726]]__
Her knife…__
*103434*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s260_030_son:70-670]]__
I know…__
*103435*__
[[S:::1740-2548]]__
but it saved you.__
*103436*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s260_040_kra:170-1000]]__
That was cunning, boy.__
*103437*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s265_010_son:90-2284]]__
The rune’s free! I think we did it.__
*103438*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrv_s265_020_mmr:27-2568]]__
Aye—let’s go see what Týr’s got for us.__
*103439*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s270_010_son:0-5550]]__
Oh, no… Freya’s protection rune— it rubbed off! What should we do?__
*103440*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s270_010_son_a:150-4550]]__
Oh, no... Freya’s protection rune— it washed off! What should we do?__
*103441*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s270_010_son_b:260-5750]]__
Oh, no... Freya’s protection rune— it washed off! What should we do?__
*103442*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s270_020_kra:80-1000]]__
We keep going.__
*103443*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s280_010_kra:18-519]]__
Boy…__
*103444*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s280_020_son:100-1290]]__
Metals from your home, you said…__
*103445*__
[[S:::2140-2640]]__
Huh!__
*103446*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s280_030_son:28-798]]__
Jörð…__
*103447*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s290_010_son:20-2000]]__
We can’t leave here without the black rune.__
*103448*__
[[S:::2000-4020]]__
C’mon, we can do this.__
*103449*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s222_010_kra:20-750]]__
What of these?__
*103450*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s222_020_son:60-1500]]__
“Thought is faster than wind.”__
*103451*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s222_030_mmr:0-2790]]__
Something to be solved with our heads rather than our feet.__
*103452*__
[[S:::3260-4250]]__
Suits me fine!__
*103453*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s222_040_mmr:40-2930]]__
Solving problems with our heads rather than our feet.__
*103454*__
[[S:::3300-4240]]__
Suits me fine!__
*103455*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s222_050_mmr:23-5091]]__
Hm… perhaps this isn’t about speed at all. Is there someplace else the winds can go?__
*103456*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s222_060_mmr:0-3000]]__
Ah. A timely hint for something we figured out ourselves!__
*103457*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s275_010_son:0-630]]__
Whew!__
*103458*__
[[S:::1610-2490]]__
He was big.__
*103459*__
[[S:::3420-4750]]__
But no match for us gods…__
*103460*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s275_020_kra:33-1338]]__
I have beaten bigger.__
*103461*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s275_030_son:0-601]]__
Heh…__
*103462*__
[[S:::870-1633]]__
“Puny troll!”…__
*103463*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrv_s275_040_mmr:0-1120]]__
Yeeeah…__
*103464*__
[[S:::1630-4500]]__
I’m turned around, which way is the sandbowl back up?__
*103465*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv06_s370_010_kra_stem:39-1274]]__
Freya!__
*103466*__
[[S:::1717-2994]]__
Open the door!__
*103467*__
[[S:::3492-4658]]__
We need your help!__
*103468*__
[[S:::6376-7652]]__
Woman, do you hear me?__
*103469*__
[[S:::8373-9315]]__
It is urgent!__
*103470*__
[[S:::12420-13917]]__
The boy has fallen ill!__
*103471*__
[[S:::14858-15747]]__
Freya!__
*103472*__
[[S:::19018-19850]]__
He is ill.__
*103473*__
[[S:::39867-41253]]__
I did this to him…?__
*103474*__
[[S:::43748-44580]]__
Will you help me?__
*103475*__
[[S:::58220-58885]]__
Hel…__
*103476*__
[[S:::61047-61934]]__
Not this one…__
*103477*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv06_s370_010_fre_stem:9850-12143]]__
I am still a god! Go away.__
*103478*__
[[S:::22343-22955]]__
Inside.__
*103479*__
[[S:::24900-26780]]__
This is no ordinary illness.__
*103480*__
[[S:::27160-30740]]__
The boy’s true nature, your true nature, fights within him.__
*103481*__
[[S:::47456-47990]]__
Of course…__
*103482*__
[[S:::49590-52590]]__
There is a rare ingredient found only in Helheim.__
*103483*__
[[S:::53030-56180]]__
The keeper that protects the Bridge of The Damned… I need its heart.__
*103484*__
[[S:::58770-60604]]__
The Realm of the Dead. Do you know it?__
*103485*__
[[S:::63050-64818]]__
It is a land of unyielding cold.__
*103486*__
[[S:::65701-70797]]__
Fires cannot burn there, and no magic in all the nine realms can create a blaze.__
*103487*__
[[S:::70972-74299]]__
As for the dead… your frost axe will be useless.__
*103488*__
[[S:::74854-76013]]__
You’ll need to find something else.__
*103489*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv06_s370_010_son_stem:33858-34681]]__
(sickly moan)__
*103490*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv06_s370_020_kra_stem:2550-3918]]__
Then I must return home…__
*103491*__
[[S:::8110-9771]]__
...dig up a past I swore__
*103492*__
[[S:::10100-11139]]__
would stay buried.__
*103493*__
[[S:::35010-35588]]__
Boy…__
*103494*__
[[S:::60010-60655]]__
Freya…__
*103495*__
[[S:::62860-64420]]__
When last we spoke… I was…__
*103496*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv06_s370_020_fre_stem:12220-13990]]__
Who you were before doesn’t matter.__
*103497*__
[[S:::15430-17670]]__
This boy is not your past, he is your son…__
*103498*__
[[S:::18550-20180]]__
and he needs his father.__
*103499*__
[[S:::24220-26470]]__
This rune opens the bridge to Helheim.__
*103500*__
[[S:::27020-31107]]__
When you are there, do not under any circumstances cross the Bridge of The Damned.__
*103501*__
[[S:::31107-33138]]__
There is no road back. Understand?__
*103502*__
[[S:::35866-36320]]__
Heimili!__
*103503*__
[[S:::37250-38090]]__
You must hurry.__
*103504*__
[[S:::38770-41468]]__
Through my garden there’s a path leading to my boat. Take it.__
*103505*__
[[S:::41468-44799]]__
Return home. Dig up your past. Do whatever you need to do.__
*103506*__
[[S:::44855-47409]]__
Just bring me back the bridge keeper’s heart,__
*103507*__
[[S:::47611-49020]]__
and your son may survive.__
*103508*__
[[S:::50500-51013]]__
Now…__
*103509*__
[[S:::64554-69352]]__
No. You are right to distrust the word of a god.__
*103510*__
[[S:::69927-72998]]__
No need to explain. Not to me. Not for that.__
*103511*__
[[S:::75040-79213]]__
I will keep him safe. That’s a mother’s promise.__
*103512*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv06_s370_020_son_stem:33858-34681]]__
(groan)__
*103513*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv06_s375_010_kra_stem:78468-83997]]__
Athena…__
*103514*__
[[S:::90036-92822]]__
Get out of my head.__
*103515*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv06_s010_010_mmr:220-1750]]__
Somebody just called the serpent.__
*103516*__
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_riv06_s020_010_fre:40-2930]]__
Use the garden door—my boat is down the path.__
*103517*__
[[S:::3900-4300]]__
Go…__
*103518*__
[[S:::5040-6000]]__
time is not our friend.__
*103519*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv06_s015_010_kra:50-1340]]__
The fever burns hotter.__
*103520*__
[[S:::1760-2500]]__
He is shaking.__
*103521*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv06_s015_020_mmr:157-1706]]__
It’s serious. We must hurry.__
*103522*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv06_s015_030_kra:101-879]]__
Atreus…__
*103523*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv06_s030_010_mmr:0-1750]]__
Helheim, of all places…__
*103524*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv06_s030_020_mmr:0-860]]__
You alright, brother?__
*103525*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv06_s030_030_kra:40-1580]]__
I will do what I must.__
*103526*__
[[S:::2000-2827]]__
Leave me be.__
*103527*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv06_s030_040_mmr:0-730]]__
As you wish.__
*103528*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv06_s030_050_mmr:12-1684]]__
Oughtn’t we get to the boat, brother?__
*103529*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro02_s380_010_ath_stem:92470-95540]]__
There’s nowhere you can hide, Spartan.__
*103530*__
[[S:::96470-100550]]__
Put as much distance between you and the truth as you want,__
*103531*__
[[S:::101560-103300]]__
it changes nothing.__
*103532*__
[[S:::104730-106900]]__
Pretend to be everything you are not…__
*103533*__
[[S:::107940-108660]]__
teacher…__
*103534*__
[[S:::109410-110380]]__
husband…__
*103535*__
[[S:::112500-113120]]__
father…__
*103536*__
[[S:::116450-120440]]__
… but there is one unavoidable truth you will never escape:__
*103537*__
[[S:::122100-123570]]__
You cannot change.__
*103538*__
[[S:::125210-127350]]__
You will always be__
*103539*__
[[S:::128440-129250]]__
a monster.__
*103540*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pro02_s380_010_kra_stem:132710-133270]]__
I know.__
*103541*__
[[S:::136670-138940]]__
But I am your monster no longer.__
*103542*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pro02_s010_010_mmr:100-2250]]__
Alright, brother… let’s see what those blades can do.__
*103543*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pro02_s020_010_mmr:90-4270]]__
My, yes… those blades will serve quite well in Helheim. And might do more besides—__
*103544*__
[[S:::4640-8000]]__
try using them to ignite that icy bramble there, covering the travel stones.__
*103545*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pro02_s020_010_mmr_a:60-2830]]__
My, yes… those blades will serve quite well in Helheim.__
*103546*__
[[S:::3250-7670]]__
Now, I believe I see a door to the Realm Between Realms over there—in your own front yard no less!__
*103547*__
[[S:::8170-11250]]__
Take the shortcut back to the realm travel temple, then on to Helheim, yeah?__
*103548*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pro02_s020_020_mmr:30-4250]]__
Brother—that icy bramble, covering the travel stones. Use your blades to clear it away.__
*103549*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pro02_s020_030_mmr:50-4400]]__
That icy bramble outside, brother—covering the travel stones. Get back out there and use your__
*103550*__
[[S:::4400-5250]]__
blades to clear it away.__
*103551*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pro02_s020_030_mmr_a:0-2110]]__
Brother… there’s no path to the temple in here.__
*103552*__
[[S:::2570-5000]]__
The door to the Realm Between Realms is outside.__
*103553*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pro02_s020_040_mmr:70-2810]]__
Those blades must indeed be hot to burn Hel’s Bramble.__
*103554*__
[[S:::3230-6690]]__
Now take the shortcut back to the realm travel temple, then on to Helheim, yeah?__
*103555*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl07_s010_010_brk:0-1670]]__
I’ll be keeping my eye on you…__
*103556*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl07_s020_010_mmr:143-2500]]__
Now that Freya’s given you the travel rune to Helheim,__
*103557*__
[[S:::2886-4303]]__
it should be unlocked on the table.__
*103558*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl07_s020_020_mmr:77-873]]__
Helheim.__
*103559*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl07_s020_030_mmr:40-1072]]__
And it’s done.__
*103560*__
[[S:::1500-2750]]__
We really are doing this.__
*103561*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl07_s030_010_brk:0-1500]]__
I’ll be watching yer back!__
*103562*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl07_s030_010_brk_a:0-1750]]__
Promise… I’ll be watching yer back!__
*103563*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl07_s040_010_mmr:60-3970]]__
Let me take this moment to tell you that what you are about to do is absolutely insane.__
*103564*__
[[S:::4420-6740]]__
Not even Odin can survive this cold,__
*103565*__
[[S:::7160-8600]]__
so I hope those blades work.__
*103566*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl08_s383_010_brk_stem:160-819]]__
What—?__
*103567*__
[[S:::1000-3320]]__
Hey! You reek of foreign magick.__
*103568*__
[[S:::4190-6065]]__
Sweet Nanna’s nethers,__
*103569*__
[[S:::6230-7500]]__
what are those…?__
*103570*__
[[S:::8940-10400]]__
I have never seen the like…__
*103571*__
[[S:::10860-12815]]__
That’s gotta be a family heirloom…__
*103572*__
[[S:::16790-17797]]__
Son,__
*103573*__
[[S:::18120-21894]]__
my brother and me created Mjölnir for the big idiot…__
*103574*__
[[S:::22070-23440]]__
I know from quality.__
*103575*__
[[S:::24070-24770]]__
And them…__
*103576*__
[[S:::25960-27040]]__
them’s special.__
*103577*__
[[S:::29130-31220]]__
Say, where’s the little turd?__
*103578*__
[[S:::35550-36440]]__
No…__
*103579*__
[[S:::37130-37970]]__
What happened?__
*103580*__
[[S:::38894-40209]]__
Aesir?__
*103581*__
[[S:::51081-54794]]__
We all gotta take responsibility sometime, huh?__
*103582*__
[[S:::55656-61386]]__
Say, what can I do to help him? I can do things. You want I should tag along?__
*103583*__
[[S:::66977-67683]]__
All right.__
*103584*__
[[S:::69989-72186]]__
So where you off to in such a hurry?__
*103585*__
[[S:::74221-77151]]__
Helheim?!? Shit… this is serious.__
*103586*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl08_s383_010_kra_stem:12750-13494]]__
NO.__
*103587*__
[[S:::14490-15836]]__
Nor will it ever be.__
*103588*__
[[S:::33530-34837]]__
He has fallen ill.__
*103589*__
[[S:::40180-40943]]__
No.__
*103590*__
[[S:::41640-42839]]__
The fault is mine…__
*103591*__
[[S:::44740-47002]]__
and my responsibility to make it right.__
*103592*__
[[S:::61630-62325]]__
No,__
*103593*__
[[S:::63150-64250]]__
Your work here…__
*103594*__
[[S:::65600-66120]]__
is enough.__
*103595*__
[[S:::72430-74027]]__
The realm of the dead.__
*103596*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl08_s010_010_brk:20-2750]]__
You made it! Better get home to your boy already!__
*103597*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl08_s020_010_mmr:97-3291]]__
We shouldn’t delay, brother—it’s straight back to Midgard with that heart.__
*103598*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl08_s030_010_mmr:140-2761]]__
Your father was Zeus.__
*103599*__
[[S:::3388-5262]]__
I finally understand.__
*103600*__
[[S:::5663-9679]]__
I’m dangling from the hip of the bloody Ghost of Sparta.__
*103601*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl08_s030_020_kra:60-1750]]__
Do NOT call me that.__
*103602*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl08_s030_030_mmr:116-3775]]__
Don’t mistake me, brother. From what I heard, the pantheon had it coming.__
*103603*__
[[S:::4402-6250]]__
But it’s still a bit to take in.__
*103604*__
[[S:::6878-10786]]__
I knew you hate gods, but you really can’t stay away from them, can you?__
*103605*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl08_s030_040_kra:190-1820]]__
You must say nothing to the boy.__
*103606*__
[[S:::2250-3500]]__
He must never know.__
*103607*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl08_s030_050_mmr:150-3130]]__
Bollocks, brother, respectfully, bollocks.__
*103608*__
[[S:::3630-7000]]__
He has to know. He’ll never be whole without the truth.__
*103609*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl08_s030_060_mmr:240-4836]]__
Look, I get it. You hate the gods. All gods.__
*103610*__
[[S:::5140-6974]]__
It’s no accident that includes yourself.__
*103611*__
[[S:::7440-9307]]__
And it includes your boy,__
*103612*__
[[S:::9794-10498]]__
don’t you see that?__
*103613*__
[[S:::10970-12174]]__
He feels that!__
*103614*__
[[S:::12650-14325]]__
He can’t help what he is.__
*103615*__
[[S:::14642-17858]]__
He can’t begin to help it, because you haven’t even told him.__
*103616*__
[[S:::18276-20205]]__
It’s all connected, man!__
*103617*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl08_s030_070_kra:78-2483]]__
You… will tell him nothing.__
*103618*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl08_s030_080_mmr:0-598]]__
Very well.__
*103619*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl08_s040_010_brk:0-4470]]__
Hey, so you know that shortcut between realms? Well, I made it better!__
*103620*__
[[S:::5080-6210]]__
Or I might have brokes it.__
*103621*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl08_s040_020_kra:40-1000]]__
We use that…__
*103622*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl08_s040_030_brk:80-890]]__
I know you do!__
*103623*__
[[S:::1380-6000]]__
So I took a few gusts from them Winds of Hel and made it so it ain’t just one-way.__
*103624*__
[[S:::6500-9000]]__
Now you can use it to travel to and from.__
*103625*__
[[S:::9600-10500]]__
If I didn’t breaks it.__
*103626*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl08_s040_040_kra:0-1250]]__
Then we can take it to Freya.__
*103627*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl08_s040_050_mmr:90-1500]]__
There’s an idea, brother!__
*103628*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl08_s040_060_brk:53-3665]]__
What’s the matter? Try out that shortcut ’tween realms!__
*103629*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl08_s040_070_mmr:76-3372]]__
We shouldn’t delay. The shortcut between realms, brother—use it.__
*103630*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl08_s040_080_mmr:100-4735]]__
This isn’t right, brother. We need the shortcut between realms—the one next to the Dwarf’s shop.__
*103631*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl08_s040_090_mmr:40-1750]]__
Back to Freya’s. Quick as can be.__
*103632*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl08_s040_100_brk:0-3120]]__
Might be some kinks to sort out, but you’ll make it.__
*103633*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl08_s040_110_mmr:0-1000]]__
Just go, brother.__
*103634*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel01_s387_010_kra_stem:43613-45315]]__
I have the heart.__
*103635*__
[[S:::45538-46972]]__
I need nothing more?__
*103636*__
[[S:::57652-58300]]__
Zeus?__
*103637*__
[[S:::61184-61980]]__
My father...__
*103638*__
[[S:::68621-70426]]__
What is that place?__
*103639*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel01_s387_010_mmr_stem:46972-48000]]__
You’re set.__
*103640*__
[[S:::48246-50016]]__
But better not to linger here though, eh?__
*103641*__
[[S:::58496-59586]]__
Zeus?!?__
*103642*__
[[S:::62306-66538]]__
Your father was Zeus?!? Well that explains a lot.__
*103643*__
[[S:::70442-74198]]__
Never go there. Understand?__
*103644*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel01_s387_010_zeu_stem:54124-55864]]__
Kratos.__
*103645*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel01_s388_010_brk_stem:1325-1971]]__
Pssst.__
*103646*__
[[S:::2567-3303]]__
Sshhh!__
*103647*__
[[S:::3754-5522]]__
I ain’t supposed to be here.__
*103648*__
[[S:::6101-7111]]__
S’cold!__
*103649*__
[[S:::7648-9400]]__
Real quick, gimme your blades.__
*103650*__
[[S:::10206-12419]]__
I said I’d help you and I aim to.__
*103651*__
[[S:::12654-13342]]__
C’mon!__
*103652*__
[[S:::17403-19189]]__
My equipment’s in Midgard.__
*103653*__
[[S:::19261-20186]]__
Be right back.__
*103654*__
[[S:::24484-25283]]__
There!__
*103655*__
[[S:::25912-27954]]__
Now they’re ready for the Winds of Hel.__
*103656*__
[[S:::28468-31811]]__
Just target this magical glowy bit here with your blades and throw.__
*103657*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel01_s388_010_mmr_stem:1981-2435]]__
Aah!__
*103658*__
[[S:::20952-21502]]__
You...__
*103659*__
[[S:::22166-23961]]__
you don’t suppose he nicked those, do you?__
*103660*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel01_s388_010_kra_stem:9413-9957]]__
Why?__
*103661*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s010_010_kra:40-1500]]__
Is this the bridge Freya spoke of?__
*103662*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s010_020_mmr:80-4900]]__
No, we’re still on the realm travel bridge. We’re after the Bridge of the Damned. The dead use it__
*103663*__
[[S:::4900-7890]]__
to cross into their permanent home, the city of Helheim.__
*103664*__
[[S:::8480-11090]]__
The bridge keeper who minds admission—he’s the one we want.__
*103665*__
[[S:::11570-14200]]__
Just follow this bridge… should lead us straight to him.__
*103666*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s010_030_mmr:0-3000]]__
You know… I’d really hoped never to see this place again.__
*103667*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s020_010_kra:30-589]]__
These dead…__
*103668*__
[[S:::1190-2500]]__
what awaits them in this Hel?__
*103669*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s020_020_mmr:0-4279]]__
If they pass muster with the bridge keeper, they can cross the Bridge of the Damned into Helheim__
*103670*__
[[S:::4280-4620]]__
Proper.__
*103671*__
[[S:::5240-10340]]__
There, the dead are appraised, sorted, processed, and otherwise put to rest.__
*103672*__
[[S:::10949-14320]]__
But judging by the amount of dead I see walking in the wrong direction,__
*103673*__
[[S:::14690-16690]]__
the gates of Hel may indeed be closed.__
*103674*__
[[S:::17270-18250]]__
We’ll soon find out.__
*103675*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s025_010_mmr:0-1200]]__
Oh, this is all wrong.__
*103676*__
[[S:::1780-4260]]__
Only the newly-dead should be here. There’s too many.__
*103677*__
[[S:::4910-9230]]__
The gate must be closed… and if the gate’s closed, then it’s true—Hel’s full up.__
*103678*__
[[S:::9730-14100]]__
Without the Valkyrie to sort and cull them, Hel is overwhelmed.__
*103679*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s025_020_mmr:0-1500]]__
Locked. Now what?__
*103680*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s030_010_kra:0-2750]]__
If this is the home of the dead, what is Valhalla?__
*103681*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s030_020_mmr:0-230]]__
Ah…__
*103682*__
[[S:::840-3740]]__
only those who die in glorious combat see Valhalla.__
*103683*__
[[S:::4390-4880]]__
The rest…__
*103684*__
[[S:::5520-5960]]__
the old,__
*103685*__
[[S:::6310-8010]]__
the diseased, the criminals…__
*103686*__
[[S:::8680-9790]]__
Valhalla’s rejects?__
*103687*__
[[S:::10389-11000]]__
They come here.__
*103688*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s030_030_mmr:0-550]]__
So tell me,__
*103689*__
[[S:::930-2030]]__
brother—where you from then?__
*103690*__
[[S:::2649-3160]]__
Hellas—no?__
*103691*__
[[S:::3860-4320]]__
Athens?__
*103692*__
[[S:::4900-5350]]__
Sparta?__
*103693*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s030_040_mmr:0-1690]]__
Still not ready to talk then?__
*103694*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s032_010_kra:0-2094]]__
When we killed the reavers near my home…__
*103695*__
[[S:::2505-3524]]__
they came here?__
*103696*__
[[S:::4743-6206]]__
How did they return so quickly?__
*103697*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s032_020_mmr:60-4676]]__
Time doesn’t move the same between all realms, especially where the spirit world is concerned.__
*103698*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s032_030_kra:40-1043]]__
Like the light of Alfheim…__
*103699*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s032_030_kra_a:40-1203]]__
Like the light of Alfheim…__
*103700*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s032_040_mmr:70-1080]]__
The opposite, in fact…__
*103701*__
[[S:::1460-6340]]__
the Lake of Souls feels faster than Alfheim time, but Hel is much slower than Midgard.__
*103702*__
[[S:::6810-8750]]__
Sorry, I’m sure that’s confusing—__
*103703*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s032_050_kra:180-3000]]__
If we will be back to my son all the sooner, that is good.__
*103704*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s032_060_mmr:20-550]]__
Ah!__
*103705*__
[[S:::870-2000]]__
Aren’t you a quick study.__
*103706*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s034_010_kra:0-1390]]__
This Valhalla…__
*103707*__
[[S:::1990-2950]]__
is it within Hel?__
*103708*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s034_020_mmr:40-830]]__
Oh no, no—__
*103709*__
[[S:::1240-3180]]__
Valhalla is part of Asgard.__
*103710*__
[[S:::3670-8050]]__
Only the worthy dead go there, the warriors who die in glorious combat.__
*103711*__
[[S:::8530-10750]]__
Hel is for those who die in dishonor.__
*103712*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s034_030_kra:20-895]]__
Criminals.__
*103713*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s034_040_mmr:0-584]]__
Aye,__
*103714*__
[[S:::984-3917]]__
and those dead of disease, mishap, age…__
*103715*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s034_050_kra:0-1670]]__
It is dishonorable to grow old?__
*103716*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s034_050_kra_a:40-1500]]__
It is dishonorable to grow old?__
*103717*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s034_060_mmr:40-530]]__
Well,__
*103718*__
[[S:::940-3000]]__
never too late to go out fighting, I suppose.__
*103719*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s036_010_mmr:17-2482]]__
That climb there could lead us out… if we could reach it.__
*103720*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s038_010_kra:40-2750]]__
Will killing the Bridge Keeper help the dead leave Midgard?__
*103721*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s038_020_mmr:18-4254]]__
I don’t expect it will. Though I don’t suppose it will make things any worse, either.__
*103722*__
[[S:::4659-8462]]__
It’ll be one less obstacle for the living to reach the inner sanctum of Helheim…__
*103723*__
[[S:::9058-10790]]__
but who’d be mad enough to go there?__
*103724*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s040_010_mmr:60-1240]]__
The Bridge of the Damned.__
*103725*__
[[S:::1720-5000]]__
And there’s the keeper, making sure the dead are really dead.__
*103726*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s040_011_kra:0-1000]]__
What is that he holds?__
*103727*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s040_020_mmr:100-5160]]__
That totem contains a powerful source of magical energy—the very power of Helheim itself.__
*103728*__
[[S:::5600-7440]]__
But what you want is his heart.__
*103729*__
[[S:::7920-9250]]__
Just take it and we can leave.__
*103730*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s040_030_kra:16-551]]__
How?__
*103731*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s040_040_mmr:160-2250]]__
Start some trouble. You can do that, right?__
*103732*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s040_050_mmr:0-1030]]__
Now the heart, brother.__
*103733*__
[[S:::1700-3250]]__
You’ll have to get your hands dirty.__
*103734*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_hel01_s050_090_brk:30-2030]]__
Right over here—that glowing bit.__
*103735*__
[[S:::2450-4750]]__
Target ’er with your blades and give ’em a clean throw.__
*103736*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_hel01_s050_100_brk:0-5060]]__
Now target that wind trap with your blades—it’s that little ball hanging in the middle of the door__
*103737*__
[[S:::5060-5840]]__
there, see it?__
*103738*__
[[S:::6460-7500]]__
Just let ’er loose.__
*103739*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_hel01_s050_110_brk:30-3200]]__
Now target that wind trap with your blades.__
*103740*__
[[S:::3400-5600]]__
See there? It’s a little ball hanging in the middle of the door.__
*103741*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_hel01_s050_120_brk:60-630]]__
See that?__
*103742*__
[[S:::1040-5880]]__
Now you can absorb and release the Winds of Hel whenever it damn pleases you, so you’re welcome and__
*103743*__
[[S:::5880-6580]]__
I’m leaving.__
*103744*__
[[S:::7040-9500]]__
This place is cold enough to freeze a pair of pigeon eggs.__
*103745*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s050_130_mmr:210-3250]]__
I sometimes wonder if there was once some sort of accident in his brain.__
*103746*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s050_140_kra:230-1250]]__
We have been away too long.__
*103747*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s060_010_mmr:0-2540]]__
Sorry, brother… I’m still stuck on what I heard back there.__
*103748*__
[[S:::3240-4500]]__
Zeus was your father?__
*103749*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s060_020_kra:0-750]]__
Not now.__
*103750*__
[[S:::1430-3450]]__
We should focus on getting out of Hel.__
*103751*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s060_030_mmr:0-1700]]__
And with that I cannot argue.__
*103752*__
[[S:::2570-4750]]__
I’ll just contemplate that little nugget in silence then.__
*103753*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s060_031_kra:30-1430]]__
Then speak no more of it.__
*103754*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s015_010_mmr:0-3500]]__
Use the fire of your blades to burn away that Hel’s Bramble blocking the path.__
*103755*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s015_020_mmr:0-620]]__
See that?__
*103756*__
[[S:::1000-3250]]__
One of the many reasons we went back for those blades…__
*103757*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s045_010_kra:0-1100]]__
How is he here?__
*103758*__
[[S:::1670-2750]]__
That is not possible.__
*103759*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s045_020_mmr:0-1490]]__
It’s just an illusion.__
*103760*__
[[S:::1970-5080]]__
Hel’s known for torturing its inhabitants with their own past.__
*103761*__
[[S:::5570-8000]]__
We should focus on getting back to your son.__
*103762*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s045_030_mmr:0-2130]]__
That lock needs a gust of Hel’s Wind to open it.__
*103763*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel01_s070_010_son:8-2716]]__
Here we go! I’m finally gonna get to see—__
*103764*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel01_s070_020_son:16-7578]]__
Why is it so cold?? I’m serious! This is unreasonable. I’ve seen enough—we can turn back now.__
*103765*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel01_s070_030_son:2-1562]]__
I can’t believe we’re back in Hel.__
*103766*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s070_040_mmr:10-3621]]__
At least we’re not on the side of the bridge where those visions will torture us.__
*103767*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel01_s070_050_son:0-1120]]__
It’s so cold,__
*103768*__
[[S:::1670-3250]]__
my spit freezes when I talk.__
*103769*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel01_s070_060_son:5-240]]__
Ptah!__
*103770*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel01_s070_070_son:0-860]]__
Okay! Great!__
*103771*__
[[S:::1490-5300]]__
We’re done here? We can leave? We can go home now? And be warm?__
*103772*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel01_s070_080_son:0-800]]__
For the record,__
*103773*__
[[S:::1160-2800]]__
I never need to come back here,__
*103774*__
[[S:::3160-3650]]__
thanks.__
*103778*__
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_riv65_s020_010_fre:90-2350]]__
Those blades are clearly not from this realm…__
*103779*__
[[S:::3580-4630]]__
they emanate heat__
*103780*__
[[S:::5280-6790]]__
and terrible cruelty.__
*103781*__
[[S:::8110-10750]]__
They will be effective against the Bridge Keeper, but you should hurry.__
*103782*__
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_riv65_s020_020_fre:60-2580]]__
The longer you delay here, the more your son will suffer.__
*103783*__
[[S:::3080-5000]]__
I can only keep him comfortable for so long.__
*103784*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv07_s390_010_fre_stem:9270-10000]]__
You have it!__
*103785*__
[[S:::20990-21840]]__
Back of your hand.__
*103786*__
[[S:::32140-33380]]__
I can break the fever,__
*103787*__
[[S:::34400-35370]]__
but to heal…__
*103788*__
[[S:::39150-40140]]__
Yes.__
*103789*__
[[S:::45140-45860]]__
Help me prop him up.__
*103790*__
[[S:::55950-57760]]__
Did I tell you that I have a son too?__
*103791*__
[[S:::59960-60590]]__
It’s been...__
*103792*__
[[S:::62420-64400]]__
forever since I last saw him.__
*103793*__
[[S:::65690-68440]]__
At his birth, the runes foretold a needless death.__
*103794*__
[[S:::69890-71520]]__
The babe in my arms was so__
*103795*__
[[S:::72470-73000]]__
small,__
*103796*__
[[S:::74640-75840]]__
so helpless.__
*103797*__
[[S:::77220-80880]]__
I knew right then I would do anything to protect him.__
*103798*__
[[S:::82050-83720]]__
No matter the sacrifice...__
*103799*__
[[S:::88900-91000]]__
Of course everything I did, I did for myself.__
*103800*__
[[S:::92480-99080]]__
I let my needs, my fears, come before what he needed...__
*103801*__
[[S:::100550-103370]]__
and I couldn’t see his resentment until it was too late.__
*103802*__
[[S:::106480-110760]]__
Don’t make the same mistake. Have faith in him.__
*103803*__
[[S:::111980-117200]]__
I know the truth isn’t simple... but nothing is when it involves your child.__
*103804*__
[[S:::159490-160310]]__
For now.__
*103805*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv07_s390_010_kra_stem:8110-8760]]__
The heart…__
*103806*__
[[S:::10280-10780]]__
Yes.__
*103807*__
[[S:::27810-28880]]__
He is still ill.__
*103808*__
[[S:::35480-37640]]__
...he must know the truth of what he is.__
*103809*__
[[S:::41610-42850]]__
It is not so simple.__
*103810*__
[[S:::124390-125530]]__
It is a curse.__
*103811*__
[[S:::127560-129230]]__
The boy has been cursed.__
*103812*__
[[S:::138850-139750]]__
I will not.__
*103813*__
[[S:::153360-154370]]__
I see that.__
*103814*__
[[S:::156080-157810]]__
Is he well enough to travel?__
*103815*__
[[S:::168450-170390]]__
You see that it does not.__
*103816*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv07_s390_010_son_stem:137237-138327]]__
Don’t leave without me.__
*103817*__
[[S:::150913-152001]]__
I’m better now.__
*103818*__
[[S:::163320-164340]]__
It won’t happen again.__
*103819*__
[[S:::166408-167900]]__
I promise.__
*103820*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv07_s400_010_kra_stem:5741-6480]]__
You are quiet.__
*103821*__
[[S:::8022-8870]]__
Are you not better?__
*103822*__
[[S:::13630-15640]]__
I know you overheard my talk with Freya.__
*103823*__
[[S:::16740-18590]]__
You think you understand. But you do not.__
*103824*__
[[S:::23430-24480]]__
Why do you say nothing?__
*103825*__
[[S:::46810-48634]]__
You do not know everything, boy.__
*103826*__
[[S:::55650-56090]]__
The truth…__
*103827*__
[[S:::59950-60450]]__
The truth.__
*103828*__
[[S:::64570-65650]]__
I am a god, boy,__
*103829*__
[[S:::67315-68871]]__
from another land, far from here.__
*103830*__
[[S:::73306-77854]]__
When I came to these shores, I chose to live as a man. But the truth is…__
*103831*__
[[S:::79236-82997]]__
I was born a god. And so were you.__
*103832*__
[[S:::88069-88526]]__
Boy?__
*103833*__
[[S:::89874-91275]]__
Have you nothing to say?__
*103834*__
[[S:::102143-105859]]__
Can you turn into an animal?__
*103835*__
[[S:::109035-113983]]__
No… no, I do not think so.__
*103836*__
[[S:::123538-127115]]__
No, she was mortal, but she knew my true nature.__
*103837*__
[[S:::140708-142032]]__
I had hoped to spare you.__
*103838*__
[[S:::143876-149697]]__
Being a god… it can be a lifetime of anguish and tragedy.__
*103839*__
[[S:::151732-153006]]__
That is the curse.__
*103840*__
[[S:::169782-176909]]__
I do not know the reach of your godhood, but over time, we will learn.__
*103841*__
[[S::vo_lvl_riv07_s400_010_son_stem:11230-12020]]__
I guess.__
*103842*__
[[S:::27448-28480]]__
You said I was cursed.__
*103843*__
[[S:::30406-32332]]__
You think I’m weak, because I’m not like you.__
*103844*__
[[S:::34158-35974]]__
I know I was never what you wanted.__
*103845*__
[[S:::37147-39862]]__
But after all this, I thought…__
*103846*__
[[S:::42133-43652]]__
maybe things were different.__
*103847*__
[[S:::50641-51261]]__
No.__
*103848*__
[[S:::52634-54343]]__
But at least I know the truth now.__
*103849*__
[[S:::94675-97742]]__
I’m… Can I…__
*103850*__
[[S:::99491-100836]]__
turn into an animal?__
*103851*__
[[S:::117647-118536]]__
I’m a god.__
*103852*__
[[S:::120081-123182]]__
Mother knew? She was a god too?__
*103853*__
[[S:::129167-130345]]__
I’m a god.__
*103854*__
[[S:::132196-133712]]__
Why did you wait so long to tell me?__
*103855*__
[[S:::157255-163073]]__
What sorts of things can I do? Can I fly? Or turn invisible?__
*103856*__
[[S:::164613-167485]]__
I don’t feel like a god.__
*103857*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv07_s010_010_mmr:10-1301]]__
Well, this isn’t right.__
*103858*__
[[S:::1922-2737]]__
But close enough.__
*103859*__
[[S:::3012-4210]]__
He did say there were kinks.__
*103860*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv07_s010_020_kra:0-750]]__
We must hurry.__
*103861*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv07_s020_005_kra:70-620]]__
Freya…__
*103862*__
[[S:::1210-2750]]__
I will not forget this.__
*103863*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv07_s020_010_son:17-521]]__
Thanks…__
*103864*__
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_riv07_s020_020_fre:0-3500]]__
Your father did the heavy lifting. You should stay. Recover.__
*103865*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv07_s020_030_kra:49-1118]]__
You have done enough.__
*103866*__
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_riv07_s020_040_fre:30-2000]]__
You know my door is always open to you.__
*103867*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv07_s020_050_son:50-640]]__
Sorry.__
*103868*__
[[S:::1090-2000]]__
Guess we’re going…__
*103869*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv07_s030_010_son:60-1620]]__
That’s Vanaheim, isn’t it?__
*103870*__
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_riv07_s030_020_fre:40-1500]]__
You figured that out, did you?__
*103871*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv07_s030_030_son:0-2132]]__
Well, the window looks like Bifröst crystal…__
*103872*__
[[S:::2426-4458]]__
and I know that’s not what’s on the other side of the wall.__
*103873*__
[[S:::4946-6232]]__
And, well…__
*103874*__
[[S:::6998-7900]]__
it makes you sad.__
*103875*__
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_riv07_s030_040_fre:50-1750]]__
You are wise for one so young.__
*103876*__
[[S:::2330-5330]]__
Yes, this is a window to a home I left long ago.__
*103877*__
[[S:::6030-7000]]__
But it is only a view.__
*103878*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv07_s030_050_son:90-1720]]__
The thing that happened to you in Alfheim…__
*103879*__
[[S:::2500-4530]]__
you can’t leave Midgard, can you?__
*103880*__
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_riv07_s030_060_fre:40-3500]]__
A “gift” from my former husband upon our separation.__
*103881*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv07_s030_070_son:70-1500]]__
Why would Odin trap you in Midgard?__
*103882*__
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_riv07_s030_080_fre:60-2470]]__
Petty cruelty would be reason enough for him.__
*103883*__
[[S:::3290-6850]]__
But as with all his rash decisions, he’s driven by fear.__
*103884*__
[[S:::7630-12160]]__
The Vanir were the greatest threat to the Aesir until our marriage brokered peace.__
*103885*__
[[S:::12690-15291]]__
Many of the Vanir now think I betrayed them…__
*103886*__
[[S:::15750-17290]]__
the fruits of my sacrifice—__
*103887*__
[[S:::18220-19960]]__
to be hated by my own kind.__
*103888*__
[[S:::20810-22050]]__
To trap me here__
*103889*__
[[S:::22460-24250]]__
is to ensure I can never make it right.__
*103890*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv07_s040_010_mmr:140-5500]]__
Now then… before Modi so rudely interrupted us, we were just about to explore Týr’s vault.__
*103891*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv07_s040_020_kra:150-2060]]__
Yes. To find the Black Rune.__
*103892*__
[[S:::2790-4750]]__
Boy, do you know the way from here?__
*103893*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv07_s040_030_son:0-1000]]__
Oh. I don’t know.__
*103894*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv07_s040_040_mmr:30-2400]]__
Sure, you do, lad. We need a boat!__
*103895*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv07_s040_050_son:0-570]]__
I dunno,__
*103896*__
[[S:::990-1950]]__
I guess we need a boat.__
*103897*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv07_s040_060_mmr:62-1673]]__
Okay then!__
*103898*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv07_s050_020_mmr:0-1250]]__
Nope! Still kinked!__
*103899*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv07_s060_010_mmr:30-790]]__
Ah, see?__
*103900*__
[[S:::1250-2310]]__
The boat washed ashore.__
*103901*__
[[S:::2940-4750]]__
Someone did call the serpent earlier.__
*103902*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv07_s060_020_kra:40-687]]__
Get in.__
*103903*__
[[S:::990-1500]]__
I will pull.__
*103904*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv07_s070_010_son:0-1500]]__
You sure I can’t turn into a wolf?__
*103905*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv07_s070_020_kra:90-2000]]__
You are welcome to surprise me…__
*103906*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv07_s015_010_mmr:15-1557]]__
Ought’n we be gettin’ back to Freya’s?__
*103907*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s267_010_son_stem:3858-10675]]__
I think I see how this works… the claw’s on one side, and if we get this unstuck—__
*103908*__
[[S:::20000-23500]]__
Oh no… I think the rope’s stuck under that rock.__
*103909*__
[[S:::25043-28302]]__
Yes sir. Sorry, sir.__
*103910*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s267_010_kra_stem:11240-11730]]__
BOY!__
*103911*__
[[S:::23900-25090]]__
That was careless.__
*103912*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s270_010_son_stem:2225-4126]]__
Wait! That one’s not broken!__
*103913*__
[[S:::6537-10014]]__
There’s a note… a Giant’s prayer.__
*103914*__
[[S:::10944-15259]]__
They’re asking their ancestors to watch over them… to guide them home.__
*103915*__
[[S:::18089-22161]]__
Wait! I think I know how it works…__
*103916*__
[[S:::34911-35753]]__
Watch.__
*103917*__
[[S:::42700-44413]]__
Wow…__
*103918*__
[[S:::55820-57597]]__
I asked them to watch over mother.__
*103919*__
[[S:::61523-63948]]__
Do you think they’ll watch over us on our way to the top?__
*103920*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s270_010_kra_stem:16850-17950]]__
Boy—__
*103921*__
[[S:::53030-54080]]__
What did you write?__
*103922*__
[[S:::67920-70902]]__
Come, boy. It is a long way up.__
*103923*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s280_010_kra_stem:4520-5130]]__
Wait, boy.__
*103924*__
[[S:::12290-13650]]__
If we can catch it off balance.__
*103925*__
[[S:::18520-19420]]__
What are you doing?__
*103926*__
[[S:::29830-30800]]__
You break right.__
*103927*__
[[S:::31520-32470]]__
Find an angle.__
*103928*__
[[S:::33010-34000]]__
Wait for my mark.__
*103929*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s280_010_son_stem:7330-8010]]__
It’s Sindri!__
*103930*__
[[S:::9790-11090]]__
Can you kill something that big?__
*103931*__
[[S:::14510-15460]]__
I can distract him.__
*103932*__
[[S:::24620-25630]]__
We have to help him.__
*103933*__
[[S:::35860-36250]]__
Thank you.__
*103942*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s290_010_son_stem:2250-4606]]__
Wow. We actually did it!__
*103943*__
[[S:::6785-7681]]__
And you—__
*103944*__
[[S:::31673-32688]]__
What are these?__
*103945*__
[[S:::37010-37594]]__
Oh.__
*103946*__
[[S:::38778-39404]]__
Thanks?__
*103947*__
[[S:::48137-50302]]__
Yeah! He said you lost your talent.__
*103948*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s290_010_sin_stem:7730-8519]]__
Ahhh…__
*103949*__
[[S:::8870-12516]]__
But—but—but—nobody’s killed a dragon for hundreds of years…__
*103950*__
[[S:::12591-14485]]__
not since the Grand Culling of the Wyrms!__
*103951*__
[[S:::14500-16512]]__
And unless I’m mistaken, you did all that…__
*103952*__
[[S:::16800-17670]]__
for me!__
*103953*__
[[S:::23590-26577]]__
You deny it all you want, but you saved me. And that…__
*103954*__
[[S:::26577-28455]]__
… deserves compensation.__
*103955*__
[[S:::32840-36572]]__
Braided mistletoe arrows. Straighter than Heimdall and perfectly weighted.__
*103956*__
[[S:::39720-40600]]__
Oh,__
*103957*__
[[S:::40810-41560]]__
okay…__
*103958*__
[[S:::41760-42590]]__
Hold on…__
*103959*__
[[S:::42720-43220]]__
uh…__
*103960*__
[[S:::43320-44160]]__
Ew, not that.__
*103961*__
[[S:::44520-45288]]__
Um…__
*103962*__
[[S:::45930-47090]]__
Have you seen my brother again?__
*103963*__
[[S:::51380-54033]]__
Oh, and that I’m selfish (no), I’m sure.__
*103964*__
[[S:::54033-56957]]__
That I value a weapon’s look (no) over its purpose.__
*103965*__
[[S:::56957-59420]]__
That I’m pretentious (no!) and uptight.__
*103966*__
[[S:::59420-60345]]__
Fussy.__
*103967*__
[[S:::60350-61505]]__
I know what he thinks.__
*103968*__
[[S:::61505-62563]]__
But he can’t hurt me any—__
*103969*__
[[S:::62563-63641]]__
AH!!__
*103970*__
[[S:::64910-65876]]__
Burn that.__
*103971*__
[[S:::69593-72802]]__
No! No-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait-wait-wait…__
*103972*__
[[S:::74122-75600]]__
I have a better idea.__
*103973*__
[[S:::76900-78717]]__
I just need a tooth from that dragon.__
*103974*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s290_010_kra_stem:18460-19450]]__
You are mistaken.__
*103975*__
[[S:::20020-21970]]__
The dragon was simply in our path… nothing more.__
*103976*__
[[S:::67380-69250]]__
I do not have time for this.__
*103977*__
[[S:::75670-76309]]__
What?__
*103978*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s295_010_sin_stem:1940-3140]]__
Yeeeah…__
*103979*__
[[S:::3660-5120]]__
I’m not touching that. Just…__
*103980*__
[[S:::5610-6310]]__
hold it out.__
*103981*__
[[S:::14460-17310]]__
Now run that along the string of your son’s bow.__
*103982*__
[[S:::19660-20610]]__
Just humor me.__
*103983*__
[[S:::31550-32600]]__
Two passes should do it.__
*103984*__
[[S:::35540-36570]]__
Gently, now!__
*103985*__
[[S:::42130-43750]]__
Oh sure, now you’re impressed.__
*103986*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s295_010_kra_stem:24890-25582]]__
Atreus…__
*103987*__
[[S:::25920-26692]]__
your bow.__
*103988*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s295_010_son_stem:40828-41433]]__
Whoa.__
*103989*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s300_010_kra_stem:10760-12500]]__
A broken quiver will slow your draw.__
*103990*__
[[S:::13810-14760]]__
Pain we endure,__
*103991*__
[[S:::15420-16990]]__
faulty weaponry we do not.__
*103992*__
[[S:::19220-19920]]__
This will do for now.__
*103993*__
[[S:::21320-23000]]__
Good?__
*103994*__
[[S:::28340-29100]]__
Go.__
*103995*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s300_010_son_stem:26572-26785]]__
Good.__
*103996*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s310_010_mmr_stem:3660-9970]]__
Ah, the very topic of conversation... a tattooed man traveling with a child.__
*103997*__
[[S:::18400-20697]]__
He doesn’t know what you are...__
*103998*__
[[S:::24378-30736]]__
Me? I’m the greatest ambassador to the gods, the Giants, and all the creatures of the Nine Realms.__
*103999*__
[[S:::31269-35970]]__
I know every corner of these lands, every language spoken, every war waged, every deal struck.__
*104000*__
[[S:::35970-43440]]__
They call me... Mimir! --smartest man alive, and I have the answer to your every question.__
*104001*__
[[S:::48200-51040]]__
Okay, there are a few gaps in my knowledge.__
*104002*__
[[S:::51594-55802]]__
But Odin’s had me imprisoned here for... 109 winters.__
*104003*__
[[S:::56950-62700]]__
I’m a clever lad, I can piece it together, I promise. Just... given time. __
*104004*__
[[S:::74400-77220]]__
Oh, then you’ve come to the wrong place, little brother.__
*104005*__
[[S:::77220-80300]]__
The highest peak in all the realms is not here in Midgard.__
*104006*__
[[S:::80300-83500]]__
It’s in Jötunheim, realm of the Giants.__
*104007*__
[[S:::89060-90270]]__
Take a look...__
*104008*__
[[S:::95110-98650]]__
This is the last known bridge to Jötunheim in all the realms.__
*104009*__
[[S:::99240-102100]]__
See that mountain, looks like a Giant’s fingers scraping the sky?__
*104010*__
[[S:::102100-106120]]__
That’s the highest peak in all the realms... Not here.__
*104011*__
[[S:::109340-112000]]__
When the Giants destroyed all other bridges to their realm,__
*104012*__
[[S:::112000-114500]]__
they locked this one up with a secret rune.__
*104013*__
[[S:::114500-116881]]__
If it still exists, only a Giant would know it.__
*104014*__
[[S:::119301-125560]]__
True. But today the winds of fate have kicked up a strange vortex of coincidence.__
*104015*__
[[S:::125560-130540]]__
Fact is, there’s only one person alive who can get you where you need to go__
*104016*__
[[S:::130540-134850]]__
…and luckily for you, my schedule’s wide open.__
*104017*__
[[S:::143020-146210]]__
It’s your best and only move from a tactical standpoint.__
*104018*__
[[S:::146400-150260]]__
It’s the one place the man who cannot be killed won’t follow you.__
*104019*__
[[S:::154784-156267]]__
First, you need to cut off my head.__
*104020*__
[[S:::157764-162420]]__
Odin made sure that no weapon, not even Thor’s hammer, could free my body from these bonds.__
*104021*__
[[S:::162420-164740]]__
But fortunately, you don’t need my body.__
*104022*__
[[S:::164740-169730]]__
The trick is, we need to find someone who can reanimate my head, using the old magic.__
*104023*__
[[S:::174421-176234]]__
And she’ll help? She might do. Worth a try!__
*104024*__
[[S:::179920-181467]]__
He tortures me, you know.__
*104025*__
[[S:::182440-183773]]__
Every day, brother.__
*104026*__
[[S:::184500-191500]]__
Odin himself sees to it personally, and believe me, there is no end to his creativity.__
*104027*__
[[S:::192000-197443]]__
Every. Single. Day. This…__
*104028*__
[[S:::198660-200430]]__
this isn’t living.__
*104029*__
[[S:::210530-215400]]__
Brother, in case you can’t resurrect me, there’s something you need know.__
*104030*__
[[S:::216500-217890]]__
The boy...__
*104031*__
[[S:::217890-221100]]__
...the longer you wait to tell him his true nature, the more damage you do.__
*104032*__
[[S:::221100-224460]]__
He will resent you, and you may lose him forever.__
*104033*__
[[S:::227603-232230]]__
Aye… so you value your privacy more than your son?__
*104034*__
[[S:::235640-236900]]__
Fair enough.__
*104035*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s310_010_kra_stem:11170-13350]]__
Boy, check their path and make sure we are alone.__
*104036*__
[[S:::14620-15820]]__
Do as I say.__
*104037*__
[[S:::20760-22030]]__
And I would keep it that way.__
*104038*__
[[S:::23460-24540]]__
Who are you?__
*104039*__
[[S:::43990-45820]]__
Why does the son of Odin hunt us?__
*104040*__
[[S:::67590-68880]]__
The boy’s mother is dead.__
*104041*__
[[S:::69550-70110]]__
She wished her—__
*104042*__
[[S:::85830-87602]]__
That could not be what she meant...__
*104043*__
[[S:::152500-153656]]__
What do we do?__
*104044*__
[[S:::169830-171170]]__
Old magic…__
*104045*__
[[S:::172080-174548]]__
there is a Witch of the Woods, she knows the old ways.__
*104046*__
[[S:::176234-178381]]__
But if she fails, you will be dead.__
*104047*__
[[S:::203862-205118]]__
Very well.__
*104048*__
[[S:::224479-227603]]__
There is much about me I would not have him know.__
*104049*__
[[S:::233000-235518]]__
I’m going to cut off your head now.__
*104050*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s310_010_son_stem:13393-14615]]__
But... we just saw them leave.__
*104051*__
[[S:::63466-66469]]__
Nobody there…just like I said.__
*104052*__
[[S:::70115-74341]]__
She wanted us to spread her ashes on the highest peak in all the realms.__
*104053*__
[[S:::83414-84800]]__
No!__
*104054*__
[[S:::106211-109948]]__
Can’t we just take that bridge? We have a Bifröst.__
*104055*__
[[S:::116881-119301]]__
And all of them left Midgard a long time ago...__
*104056*__
[[S:::141234-143020]]__
We’re going to Jötunheim, right?__
*104057*__
[[S:::153676-154784]]__
Yes!__
*104058*__
[[S:::156267-157547]]__
Wait, what?__
*104059*__
[[S:::205118-206333]]__
I can’t watch this.__
*104060*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s001_010_son:38-1039]]__
The mouth… we made it.__
*104062*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s001_020_kra:80-1000]]__
More Black Breath.__
*104063*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s002_010_son:20-2130]]__
Where are we going? The entrance was back there.__
*104064*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s002_020_kra:78-1014]]__
Are you in a hurry?__
*104065*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s002_030_son:140-3500]]__
No! But you normally are. I’m happy to keep exploring.__
*104066*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s003_010_son:39-1930]]__
You want to leave already? We just got here.__
*104067*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s005_010_son:150-4867]]__
That emblem—it matches the one on the door to Jötunheim in Týr’s temple. The Giants did come here!__
*104068*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s010_010_son:90-1600]]__
Is that… a deer?__
*104069*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s010_020_son:46-3612]]__
I don’t remember stories of a Giant with a deer head. Wonder who he is?__
*104070*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_010_son:0-2220]]__
No way across, but there’s a sand bowl.__
*104071*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_011_son:76-1093]]__
Maybe the riddle will help?__
*104072*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_012_kra:80-894]]__
What does it say?__
*104073*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_013_son:50-1020]]__
“No yoked beast,__
*104074*__
[[S:::1390-3920]]__
nor fearful thrall / Nor rooted tree__
*104075*__
[[S:::4370-5500]]__
doth know my call.”__
*104076*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_014_kra:86-679]]__
Hm.__
*104077*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_020_kra:43-682]]__
Nothing.__
*104078*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_030_kra:75-885]]__
The floor, boy.__
*104079*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_040_son:62-2442]]__
That doesn’t mean anything. Something’s missing.__
*104080*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_050_son:80-1868]]__
Think there’s a second light crystal around here?__
*104081*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_060_kra:0-500]]__
Seek it out.__
*104082*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_070_son:0-1220]]__
I’ve looked all over this room.__
*104083*__
[[S:::1660-2990]]__
Don’t see the other crystal anywhere…__
*104084*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_080_son:50-450]]__
Oh!__
*104085*__
[[S:::800-2000]]__
How do you think that got up there?__
*104086*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_090_son:91-3672]]__
This place must have been important to the Giants. It’s like they’re testing us.__
*104087*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_100_son:29-1517]]__
Okay, that looks right.__
*104088*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_110_son:60-900]]__
Still no help.__
*104089*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_120_son:0-1250]]__
I can almost make it out…__
*104090*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_130_kra:71-989]]__
What is the riddle?__
*104091*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_140_son:190-3080]]__
“No yoked beast, nor fearful thrall /__
*104092*__
[[S:::3620-6260]]__
Nor rooted tree doth know my call.”__
*104093*__
[[S:::7290-8200]]__
Not sure what a__
*104094*__
[[S:::8620-9530]]__
“thrall” is, but__
*104095*__
[[S:::9910-10750]]__
“freedom” fits the rest.__
*104096*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s032_010_son:60-3000]]__
Why are we leaving? Pretty sure the way up the mountain is inside.__
*104097*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s035_010_son:39-3477]]__
Is that… sap? In a cave? Weird.__
*104099*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s040_010_son:49-1758]]__
Runes! I can read it now!__
*104100*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s040_020_kra:122-978]]__
Is it the answer?__
*104101*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s040_030_son:140-630]]__
“Freedom” …__
*104102*__
[[S:::1190-2000]]__
sure, that works!__
*104103*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s040_040_kra:60-890]]__
The runes.__
*104104*__
[[S:::1420-3000]]__
A riddle answer for that sand bowl?__
*104105*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s040_050_son:60-990]]__
It means “freedom.”__
*104106*__
[[S:::1490-2050]]__
Let’s try it!__
*104107*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s040_060_kra:140-750]]__
Go ahead.__
*104108*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s040_070_son:0-392]]__
Sure.__
*104109*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s040_080_son:54-785]]__
Frelsa__
*104110*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s050_010_son:62-697]]__
What’s it doing?__
*104111*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s050_020_son:0-1897]]__
Oh! Thought maybe there’d be a bridge.__
*104112*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s050_030_kra:67-3021]]__
Rrrn. Your Giants mean to test us further.__
*104113*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s055_010_son:87-2549]]__
There’s a crystal in that torch holder. Should I light it?__
*104114*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s055_020_son:40-750]]__
That helps, right?__
*104115*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s060_010_son:0-1440]]__
Guess we have to down to go up?__
*104116*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s070_010_kra:110-2650]]__
These passages seem too small for Giants.__
*104117*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s070_020_son:59-628]]__
(giggles)__
*104118*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s070_030_kra:0-750]]__
Why do you laugh?__
*104119*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s070_040_son:40-1500]]__
Oh… you’re serious.__
*104120*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s070_050_kra:70-1590]]__
I am always serious.__
*104121*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s070_060_son:0-580]]__
I forget…__
*104122*__
[[S:::1100-3430]]__
mom always said you never took an interest in history.__
*104123*__
[[S:::3940-6700]]__
Giants are just a race, like Elves and Huldrafolk.__
*104124*__
[[S:::7341-8492]]__
It doesn’t mean they’re big.__
*104125*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s070_070_kra:60-1250]]__
What of the World Serpent?__
*104126*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s070_080_son:0-2450]]__
Okay, in that case, Giant also means big.__
*104127*__
[[S:::2820-3940]]__
But there’s only one of him.__
*104128*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s080_010_kra:40-540]]__
Boy…__
*104129*__
[[S:::940-1750]]__
another light crystal.__
*104130*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s085_010_son:90-1540]]__
Just look at this place.__
*104131*__
[[S:::1900-3000]]__
It feels so—__
*104132*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s085_020_kra:104-760]]__
Dead.__
*104133*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s085_030_son:60-1630]]__
I was gonna say “ancient,”__
*104134*__
[[S:::1900-2400]]__
but__
*104135*__
[[S:::2980-3750]]__
dead works too.__
*104136*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s090_010_son:107-1340]]__
How’d you know that was there?__
*104137*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s109_010_son:430-2250]]__
Uhh… this is a lot of bodies.__
*104138*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s110_010_kra:80-1000]]__
Tell me what you see.__
*104139*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s110_020_son:0-2620]]__
Well… they look like men, not Giants.__
*104140*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s110_030_kra:80-570]]__
Correct.__
*104141*__
[[S:::920-1970]]__
Thieves seeking treasure.__
*104142*__
[[S:::2340-3000]]__
See the traps?__
*104143*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s110_040_son:90-2430]]__
Oh yeah. Lucky for us they set ’em all off.__
*104144*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s110_050_kra:110-1750]]__
Be grateful these stay dead.__
*104145*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s120_010_son:90-2053]]__
The statue! We made it across!__
*104146*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s120_020_son:79-1585]]__
Guess we’re not going back that way.__
*104147*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s130_010_son:60-691]]__
Ohhh…__
*104148*__
[[S:::960-2010]]__
this is Duraþrór,__
*104149*__
[[S:::2500-4430]]__
one of the four stags of the World Tree.__
*104150*__
[[S:::5180-8250]]__
He’s supposed to watch the entrance to Jötunheim while the Giants sleep.__
*104151*__
[[S:::9200-10000]]__
Think he’s still there?__
*104152*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s130_020_kra:80-750]]__
I do not know.__
*104153*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s140_010_son:24-678]]__
Where to now?__
*104154*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s140_020_kra:70-1550]]__
The peak is still our goal…__
*104155*__
[[S:::2080-3000]]__
we find a way up.__
*104156*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s145_010_son:30-1750]]__
Nothing down here but some weird sap.__
*104157*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s145_020_son:44-3617]]__
It’s that weird sap again. I think we’re on the other side.__
*104158*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s147_010_son:60-640]]__
Wow.__
*104159*__
[[S:::1630-3160]]__
“The highest peak in the realms.”__
*104160*__
[[S:::3680-5390]]__
Think Mom knew this was the Giant’s mountain?__
*104161*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s147_020_kra:100-4710]]__
No. Her request has been more… complicated, than she could have foreseen.__
*104162*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s148_010_kra:104-996]]__
Those runes…__
*104163*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s148_020_son:90-1100]]__
It’s a name, I think—__
*104164*__
[[S:::1670-2550]]__
Hræzlyr.__
*104165*__
[[S:::3110-4000]]__
It means “terror”.__
*104166*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s150_010_son:55-3749]]__
Hey, who do you think lit these torches? The dead don’t need light.__
*104167*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s150_020_kra:110-750]]__
Eyes open.__
*104168*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s155_010_son:59-576]]__
HELLOOOO!__
*104169*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s155_020_kra:0-600]]__
Stop that.__
*104170*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s155_030_son:46-1308]]__
C’mon, I was just—__
*104171*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s155_040_son:34-563]]__
Okay…__
*104172*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s160_010_son:30-630]]__
Whoa…__
*104173*__
[[S:::1260-2380]]__
what is all this?__
*104174*__
[[S:::3000-3750]]__
Where are we?__
*104175*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s160_020_kra:150-700]]__
A mine…__
*104176*__
[[S:::1360-3060]]__
and if this claw reaches the summit,__
*104177*__
[[S:::3470-4650]]__
our goal is near.__
*104178*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s160_030_son:40-1420]]__
Alright. How do we use it?__
*104179*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s163_010_son:0-2000]]__
There’s gotta be a way to make that claw work.__
*104180*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s163_020_son:0-2550]]__
There’s a machine with gears and rope by that torch.__
*104181*__
[[S:::2700-4070]]__
What do you think that’s for?__
*104182*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s167_010_son:100-1250]]__
Well that’s not going anywhere.__
*104183*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s175_010_son:182-2621]]__
We don’t have to leave. I’m sure we can figure this out.__
*104184*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s180_010_son:49-749]]__
It’s stuck.__
*104185*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s180_020_son:80-2030]]__
But maybe we can find a way up through there!__
*104186*__
[[S:::2530-3260]]__
After… you know…__
*104187*__
[[S:::3760-4750]]__
getting rid of those things.__
*104188*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s180_021_son:52-4251]]__
But maybe we can find a way up through there!… Uhhh… after getting rid of that!__
*104189*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s180_030_son:30-2900]]__
I don’t think that’s a good idea. You might snap the rope.__
*104190*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s180_040_son:80-2000]]__
Maybe we should find a way up to it instead?__
*104191*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s190_010_son:54-2017]]__
Looks like something’s supposed to roll on these.__
*104192*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s200_010_son:56-841]]__
See anything?__
*104193*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s200_020_kra:60-750]]__
Mining cart.__
*104194*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s200_030_son:121-1097]]__
That could be useful, yeah?__
*104195*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s210_020_kra:40-3500]]__
We need to free the rope from under the mess you created up there, boy.__
*104196*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s210_030_son:30-1460]]__
I get it. I screwed up.__
*104197*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s210_040_son:0-1750]]__
Maybe if you pull on the crank really hard, it’ll come free?__
*104198*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s210_050_son:0-2500]]__
Maybe there’s a way up there through the passage that opened?__
*104199*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s210_060_kra:60-800]]__
We will see.__
*104200*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s220_010_son:220-2500]]__
The machinery in here looks almost Dwarven,__
*104201*__
[[S:::2700-5000]]__
but the stonework… that’s definitely Jötun.__
*104202*__
[[S:::5200-9400]]__
You know, I think the Giants not only mined the mountain, but actually lived here.__
*104203*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s230_010_son:43-547]]__
What’s that?__
*104204*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s230_020_son:50-608]]__
Weird.__
*104205*__
[[S:::794-4210]]__
There’s a candle all tangled up with string and some sort of animal hide.__
*104206*__
[[S:::4455-5536]]__
Some kind of lantern?__
*104207*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s230_030_son:0-750]]__
No wick though.__
*104208*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s230_040_kra:270-3000]]__
That is of no use to us. The Bifröst lights our way.__
*104209*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s232_010_son:90-2727]]__
Wow. How big is this place?__
*104210*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s232_020_kra:90-1371]]__
It is a mountain.__
*104211*__
[[S:::2030-2660]]__
Big.__
*104212*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s235_010_kra:0-750]]__
More traps.__
*104213*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s235_020_son:130-2250]]__
There’s a tunnel, but you won’t fit.__
*104214*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s235_030_kra:44-546]]__
Take it.__
*104215*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s235_040_son:50-683]]__
Okay—__
*104216*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s237_010_son:0-1250]]__
Sure is dark in here.__
*104217*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s237_020_son:200-1460]]__
It’s really hard to see.__
*104218*__
[[S:::1960-3660]]__
Want me to light the torch crystal over there?__
*104219*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s238_010_son:20-583]]__
You okay?__
*104220*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s238_010_son_a:70-729]]__
You okay?__
*104221*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s238_020_kra:90-750]]__
Of course.__
*104222*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s240_010_son:41-776]]__
What happened to him?__
*104223*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s240_020_kra:82-780]]__
It died.__
*104224*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s240_030_son:0-1361]]__
Well. Yeah…__
*104225*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s240_040_son:82-2472]]__
Think you can move it? Looks kind of heavy.__
*104226*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s240_050_kra:70-1250]]__
I can move it.__
*104227*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s240_060_son:45-755]]__
It moves!__
*104228*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s240_070_son:150-1220]]__
Aaand we’re stuck.__
*104229*__
[[S:::1810-2500]]__
Cart’s still attached to the—__
*104230*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s240_080_kra:47-749]]__
I see that.__
*104231*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s240_090_kra:60-590]]__
There.__
*104232*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s240_100_son:38-532]]__
Let’s go!__
*104233*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s250_010_son:40-1300]]__
It’s the main room, but__
*104234*__
[[S:::1740-2750]]__
how do we get through that?__
*104235*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s250_020_kra:0-1750]]__
Look for the draw chain that opens it.__
*104236*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s260_010_son:93-1824]]__
Maybe there’s a way through the big gate up there?__
*104237*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s265_010_son:29-1267]]__
That’s it! Come on up.__
*104238*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s265_010_son_a:29-583]]__
That’s it!__
*104239*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s265_020_son:0-750]]__
No way up from here…__
*104240*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s270_010_son:82-742]]__
It’s working!__
*104241*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s270_010_son_a:110-784]]__
It’s working!__
*104242*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s275_010_son:81-1386]]__
Look at all this old stuff.__
*104243*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s275_020_kra:120-2472]]__
If it is not useful, leave it alone.__
*104244*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s275_030_son:24-368]]__
I know.__
*104245*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s280_010_son:112-2284]]__
Okay! I think we can get to that rock now.__
*104246*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s280_010_son_a:30-2150]]__
Okay! I think we can get to that rock now.__
*104247*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s280_020_son:116-3356]]__
Still need to free the rope. Think you can use the cart to get us up there?__
*104248*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s280_020_son_a:87-3439]]__
Still need to free the rope. Think you can use the cart to get us up there?__
*104249*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s280_030_son:110-1028]]__
I think it’s up ahead.__
*104250*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s290_010_son:68-1563]]__
Look! Another lantern!__
*104251*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s290_020_kra:60-710]]__
Broken.__
*104252*__
[[S:::1100-1750]]__
Leave it.__
*104253*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s290_030_son:138-4554]]__
What could they be for? There’s something special about them. I can feel it.__
*104254*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s299_010_son:52-1080]]__
Well, that looks heavy.__
*104255*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s299_020_son:0-500]]__
No way.__
*104256*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s299_030_son:0-450]]__
How—?!__
*104257*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s299_040_son:12-4005]]__
You did it! I bet we can make the rope wheel work now. Might give us a way to the top!__
*104258*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s299_050_son:73-3123]]__
The rope’s still pinned under the rock. Don’t we need to move it first?__
*104259*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s300_010_kra:7-629]]__
Your quiver.__
*104260*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s300_020_son:0-1867]]__
Strap broke when we fought the dragon.__
*104261*__
[[S:::2429-2950]]__
It’s all right—__
*104262*__
[[S:::3360-3910]]__
I can hold it.__
*104263*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s300_030_kra:12-370]]__
Stop.__
*104264*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_014_son:40-1470]]__
You hear those voices too, right?__
*104265*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_015_kra:40-1500]]__
Yes. Be silent…__
*104266*__
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_020_bld:40-4000]]__
You know why we’re here. My last visit manage to loosen your tongue?__
*104267*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_030_son:83-3375]]__
That sounds like the same man who came to our house. You said you killed him…__
*104268*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_040_kra:15-450]]__
Sshhh.__
*104269*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_050_mmr:130-1520]]__
I see you brought company this time.__
*104270*__
[[S:::2490-6850]]__
Must be important if the sons of Thor deign to grace me with their presence.__
*104271*__
[[S:::7400-8080]]__
Tell me…__
*104272*__
[[S:::8450-11250]]__
you two still tripping over yourselves to impress daddy?__
*104273*__
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_060_bld:20-3700]]__
The tattooed man. Tracks show he now travels with a child.__
*104274*__
[[S:::4050-5250]]__
Where would they go next?__
*104275*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_070_mmr:340-1750]]__
Why would I know that?__
*104276*__
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_080_mgi:0-2380]]__
You’re the smartest man alive, aren’t you?__
*104277*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_090_mmr:50-2000]]__
Smarter than all the dead ones, too.__
*104278*__
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_100_bld:0-3940]]__
You help me, I help you. Tell me where they are__
*104279*__
[[S:::4300-5500]]__
and I’ll talk to Odin—__
*104280*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_110_mmr:36-5165]]__
Your father won’t let me go, Baldur, and he won’t let you kill me. You have nothing to offer me.__
*104281*__
[[S:::5165-11871]]__
So take your questions, take your threats, take these two worthless wankers, and piss off.__
*104282*__
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_120_mdi:30-1174]]__
When no one’s looking…__
*104283*__
[[S:::1655-3261]]__
we’ll be back for your other eye.__
*104284*__
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_130_mgi:0-1228]]__
Don’t you forget…__
*104285*__
[[S:::1690-2795]]__
we’re everywhere.__
*104286*__
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_140_mdi:126-1547]]__
We really are, aren’t we?__
*104287*__
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_150_bld:110-2655]]__
Oh, shut up you idiots.__
*104288*__
[[S:::3310-4268]]__
Let’s go.__
*104289*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s310_010_kra:0-1000]]__
Back to the wheel.__
*104290*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s320_010_son:10-800]]__
It’s working!__
*104291*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s320_020_son:24-977]]__
We got the claw back!__
*104292*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s320_030_son:160-1250]]__
Oop—there it goes again…__
*104293*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s320_040_son:46-3362]]__
If we could just ride up with the claw somehow, we’d be to the top in no time…__
*104294*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s320_050_son:450-1560]]__
Ohh, I see what we’re doing…__
*104295*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s320_060_son:93-2017]]__
It fits! That’s perfect…__
*104296*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s320_070_son:35-1348]]__
Hey, wait for us…!__
*104297*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s320_080_son:50-1500]]__
How do we keep those gears from moving?__
*104298*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s320_085_son:166-4585]]__
You’ve been able to freeze gears with your axe before… What about the ones next to the rope wheel?__
*104299*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s320_090_son:11-611]]__
That should hold it.__
*104300*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s320_100_son:38-693]]__
Here we go!__
*104301*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s330_010_son:40-1110]]__
Do you think this goes all the way up to the top?__
*104302*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s330_020_kra:80-1250]]__
We will see soon enough.__
*104303*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s330_030_son:90-1010]]__
Something…__
*104304*__
[[S:::1450-2730]]__
feels strange up there.__
*104305*__
[[S:::3580-4850]]__
We’re heading into danger.__
*104306*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s330_040_kra:100-2510]]__
Do not concern yourself with what might be.__
*104307*__
[[S:::3230-4590]]__
Focus on what is…__
*104308*__
[[S:::5100-6000]]__
and be vigilant.__
*104309*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s330_050_son:17-454]]__
Yes, sir.__
*104310*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s340_010_son:70-760]]__
Not the top…__
*104311*__
[[S:::1150-1940]]__
but we’re closer.__
*104312*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s342_010_son:40-900]]__
Whoa. What’s it—__
*104313*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s342_020_kra:19-568]]__
Stay back!__
*104314*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s342_030_kra:24-1127]]__
More tests.__
*104315*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s342_040_son:30-1000]]__
Nice moment ruined.__
*104316*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s343_010_son:24-631]]__
More of ’em!__
*104317*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s343_020_kra:90-915]]__
The tunnel, boy.__
*104318*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s343_030_son:0-440]]__
Got it.__
*104319*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s343_040_son:18-631]]__
Be careful.__
*104320*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s345_010_son:135-3889]]__
Dwarves must have carved these tunnels around the Giants' traps. Good thing too.__
*104321*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s345_020_son:110-1500]]__
Well… good for me anyway.__
*104322*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s346_010_son:28-401]]__
What the—?__
*104323*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s346_020_son:22-1171]]__
Oh come ON.__
*104324*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s346_030_kra:41-1217]]__
That is not helping.__
*104325*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s346_040_kra:10-1500]]__
Stay here until it is safe.__
*104326*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s346_050_son:50-1250]]__
None of this is safe.__
*104327*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s346_060_kra:70-1000]]__
You will know when.__
*104328*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s346_070_son:54-1157]]__
See you on the other side.__
*104329*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s350_010_son:110-3400]]__
Another mining lift! It may not be as long a way up as we thought.__
*104330*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s350_020_son:60-2500]]__
Looks like the only way up is with the lift, somehow.__
*104331*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s350_030_son:40-1060]]__
How do we make it go?__
*104332*__
[[S:::1710-2750]]__
Maybe we’re too heavy?__
*104333*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s350_040_son:19-542]]__
That did it!__
*104334*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s350_060_son:0-580]]__
Or not.__
*104335*__
[[S:::1020-2000]]__
Are we still too heavy?__
*104336*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s355_010_son:80-1575]]__
All right! We’re moving again.__
*104337*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s355_020_son:0-2750]]__
Hey, when we get to the summit__
*104338*__
[[S:::2800-4350]]__
how far do you think we’ll be able to see?__
*104339*__
[[S:::4600-7850]]__
The lake? The World Serpent? Our house?__
*104340*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s355_030_kra:210-1670]]__
We will see when we get there.__
*104341*__
[[S:::2070-2750]]__
Until then,__
*104342*__
[[S:::3140-3750]]__
eyes open.__
*104343*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s360_010_son:0-380]]__
Whoa!__
*104344*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s360_020_kra:35-574]]__
Atreus?!__
*104345*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s360_030_son:83-5761]]__
I’m fine. Just lost my balance for a moment. You know, for someone so strong, you sure worry a lot.__
*104346*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s360_040_kra:140-3000]]__
It serves me well… and how I keep us alive.__
*104347*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s360_050_son:0-540]]__
I guess.__
*104348*__
[[S:::1050-2500]]__
Not a terribly fun way to live though.__
*104349*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s365_010_kra:50-1676]]__
How was that for “fun?”__
*104350*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s365_020_son:0-550]]__
I get it.__
*104351*__
[[S:::910-1710]]__
I should worry more.__
*104352*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s370_010_son:32-1054]]__
Is this where we get off?__
*104353*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s370_020_kra:80-1500]]__
No. We are stuck.__
*104354*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s370_025_son:80-2750]]__
I think part of the lift is stuck in that wall. Can you get it free?__
*104355*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s370_030_son:98-1338]]__
How much farther do we have to go?__
*104356*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s370_040_kra:20-850]]__
I do not know.__
*104357*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s370_050_son:33-1215]]__
Think we’ll get attacked again?__
*104358*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s370_060_kra:82-1004]]__
Definitely.__
*104359*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s370_070_son:30-831]]__
Oh boy.__
*104360*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s370_080_kra:30-590]]__
Yes.__
*104361*__
[[S:::1060-1750]]__
Now, be ready.__
*104362*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s375_010_son:18-812]]__
Stuck again.__
*104363*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s375_020_kra:110-700]]__
I know.__
*104364*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s375_030_son:80-2850]]__
Shouldn’t we get moving? They could be back any moment.__
*104365*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s375_040_son:86-1170]]__
I think we’re safe now.__
*104366*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s375_050_kra:63-1111]]__
It would seem.__
*104367*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s375_060_son:150-760]]__
Father?__
*104368*__
[[S:::1110-2650]]__
After we scatter Mother’s ashes…__
*104369*__
[[S:::3250-3770]]__
what then?__
*104370*__
[[S:::4300-5020]]__
What comes next?__
*104371*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s375_070_kra:70-1320]]__
Nothing comes next.__
*104372*__
[[S:::1950-2690]]__
We go home.__
*104373*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s375_080_son:61-2094]]__
That’s it? The adventure is over?__
*104374*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s375_090_kra:80-680]]__
For now.__
*104375*__
[[S:::1620-3060]]__
But we will have much to do.__
*104376*__
[[S:::4210-7750]]__
You were right earlier—on the boat after cutting down the last tree.__
*104377*__
[[S:::8550-10840]]__
You said it felt like something had changed.__
*104378*__
[[S:::11430-12190]]__
And it has,__
*104379*__
[[S:::12910-14700]]__
and our home is no longer safe.__
*104380*__
[[S:::15520-16910]]__
But it will be again.__
*104381*__
[[S:::17580-19500]]__
And we must continue your training.__
*104382*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s375_100_son:0-400]]__
Okay.__
*104383*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_010_son:21-3198]]__
We’re almost at the summit. Nothing’s gonna stop us—__
*104384*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_015_kra:0-500]]__
What is it boy?__
*104385*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_020_son:15-723]]__
DRAGON!!!__
*104386*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_030_son:90-450]]__
Aaahh!__
*104387*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_040_kra:38-2243]]__
Calm yourself, boy! And stay behind me!__
*104388*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_050_son:0-600]]__
Yes, sir!__
*104389*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_060_kra:27-1121]]__
Watch the talons!__
*104390*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_070_son:32-604]]__
Look out!__
*104391*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_080_son:26-659]]__
Here he comes!__
*104392*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_090_son:37-639]]__
Watch out!__
*104393*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_100_son:71-895]]__
What are you doing?!__
*104394*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_110_kra:0-750]]__
Be ready!__
*104395*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_120_kra:32-767]]__
Hold on!__
*104396*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s385_010_son:40-2250]]__
Phew… That was intense.__
*104397*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s385_020_kra:0-525]]__
Hold.__
*104398*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s385_030_son:56-1227]]__
Whoah… What was that?__
*104399*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s385_040_son:23-1638]]__
That looks like a root of the Yggdrasil tree!__
*104400*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s385_050_son:81-1423]]__
Is that its sap?__
*104401*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s385_060_kra:40-1080]]__
Crystalized sap…__
*104402*__
[[S:::1730-3000]]__
and there is power inside.__
*104403*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s385_070_son:0-940]]__
Maybe try throwing it?__
*104404*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s385_080_son:41-734]]__
Incredible!__
*104405*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s390_010_son:132-5032]]__
I can’t believe we fought a dragon! I was aiming for his eyes, but I kept losing my footing.__
*104406*__
[[S:::5509-11777]]__
Do you think this is their home? Did they move in after the Giants left? Or are they WHY the Giants left?__
*104407*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s390_020_kra:40-928]]__
Boy.__
*104408*__
[[S:::1367-4180]]__
The air grows thin here. No more questions.__
*104409*__
[[S:::4640-5488]]__
Breathe.__
*104410*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s390_030_son:70-570]]__
Oh…__
*104411*__
[[S:::932-1569]]__
yes…__
*104412*__
[[S:::2070-2482]]__
I see…__
*104413*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s392_010_sin:56-1076]]__
Ahh! Ahhh!__
*104414*__
[[S:::1489-2136]]__
Go away!__
*104415*__
[[S:::2312-3417]]__
Shoo! Shoo!__
*104416*__
[[S:::3524-4884]]__
Ahh! Help!__
*104417*__
[[S:::5156-6805]]__
Help!!!__
*104418*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s392_020_son:110-2180]]__
Do you hear that? It sounds like someone screaming.__
*104419*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s393_010_son:129-2049]]__
Hey ugly! Over here!__
*104420*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s393_020_son:36-738]]__
You okay?__
*104421*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s393_030_sin:48-701]]__
For now!__
*104422*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s395_010_kra:0-600]]__
GO!__
*104423*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s395_020_son:60-2230]]__
Father! Try using one of those crystals!__
*104424*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s395_030_kra:30-1250]]__
Boy! Are you okay?__
*104425*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s395_040_son:0-480]]__
Yeah!__
*104426*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s395_050_kra:60-1140]]__
I have a plan!__
*104427*__
[[S:::1710-4000]]__
Be ready to lower the crane on my mark!__
*104428*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s395_060_son:62-1812]]__
But… I don’t know how this thing works!__
*104429*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s395_070_kra:70-1160]]__
I do not care!__
*104430*__
[[S:::1540-2250]]__
Be ready!__
*104431*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s395_080_kra:32-646]]__
NOW!!!__
*104432*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s395_090_kra:117-2616]]__
Rrrrrrgh!__
*104433*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s400_010_sin:0-1200]]__
I just need one tooth.__
*104434*__
[[S:::1640-3180]]__
I promise you’re going to like this.__
*104435*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s400_020_sin:40-2601]]__
Watch where you grab tha… oh… nevermind.__
*104436*__
[[S:::2916-4130]]__
(gag) So unclean.__
*104437*__
[[S:::4480-6436]]__
(heave) So, so unclean.__
*104438*__
[[S:::7200-7700]]__
(gag)__
*104439*__
[[S:::8543-9246]]__
Oh the smell!__
*104440*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s400_030_sin:100-650]]__
Perfect—__
*104441*__
[[S:::1160-1880]]__
that should do…__
*104442*__
[[S:::2400-2950]]__
ugh__
*104443*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s410_010_sin:1230-2260]]__
Oh… How do I explain this?__
*104444*__
[[S:::3230-8090]]__
I’ve added a new vibrating pattern to the bowstring’s fibers. Aiming it at that hardened world tree__
*104445*__
[[S:::8090-10250]]__
sap will vibrate its patterns to fracture point.__
*104446*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s410_020_son:0-940]]__
What’s… that mean?__
*104447*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s410_030_sin:850-3420]]__
It makes certain crystals go boom. Trust me,__
*104448*__
[[S:::3970-4620]]__
you’ll love it.__
*104449*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s410_040_sin:110-4000]]__
Oh! Oh… I see you figured it out on your own then. Just… Nevermind.__
*104450*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s410_050_sin:42-5619]]__
I wasn’t just explaining the beautiful and complex artistry of my craft or anything… No, just…__
*104451*__
[[S:::5619-7086]]__
anything to help you. Yup!__

Feels like it wasn’t that long ago we were hunting deer. Now we’ve fought Dark Elves, and trolls,__
*104453*__
[[S:::6422-10399]]__
and ogres, and a dragon! I feel like we can beat anything now.__
*104454*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s420_020_kra:170-2230]]__
We win because we are determined.__
*104455*__
[[S:::2640-3340]]__
Disciplined.__
*104456*__
[[S:::3820-6000]]__
Not because we feel ourselves superior.__
*104457*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s420_030_son:60-1360]]__
Sure… I know…__
*104458*__
[[S:::2030-2590]]__
It’s just…__
*104459*__
[[S:::3230-4360]]__
it feels good to be strong.__
*104460*__
[[S:::4790-5350]]__
You know?__
*104461*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s420_040_kra:90-640]]__
… Yes.__
*104462*__
[[S:::1110-1700]]__
I know.__
*104463*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s423_010_kra:29-630]]__
Stuck.__
*104464*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s423_011_son:0-2500]]__
Wonder if there’s another crystal around we could use on those roots?__
*104465*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s423_020_son:170-800]]__
There we go.__

[[S:::1560-2270]]__
Want me to shatter it?__
*104467*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s423_030_son:40-1800]]__
Just say the word and I’ll shatter it.__

Oh, I’m gonna like this.__
*104469*__
[[S:::2080-4100]]__
Strange though… that one didn’t completely blow up.__
*104470*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s423_050_son:90-3000]]__
That crystal… I shot it once, but it’s glowing again…__
*104471*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s423_060_kra:80-1690]]__
The crystal renews itself.__
*104472*__

Useful.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s423_070_son:13-461]]__
All right!__
*104474*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s427_010_son:75-2793]]__
Look! There’s a bridge over there. But how do we get to it?__
*104475*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s427_020_son:89-3482]]__
We gotta find a way to lower that bridge. That has to be the way out of here.__
*104476*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s427_030_son:24-321]]__
Got it!__
*104477*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s427_040_son:20-2400]]__
Oh. Guess not. Now it’s stuck on the other side.__
*104478*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s427_050_son:65-3731]]__
C’mon… we got it to fall halfway. There has to be a way bring it down.__
*104479*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s427_060_son:72-2422]]__

Not long now, mom.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s440_010_son:124-2733]]__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s440_020_kra:0-2000]]__
Steady, boy. Mind your footing.__
*104484*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s440_030_son:40-1180]]__
There must be some way up…__
*104485*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s450_010_son:116-6966]]__
Jötunheim. We’re going to Jötunheim. We’re going to find the long-lost realm of the Giants. That’s…__
*104486*__
[[S:::6966-7504]]__
that’s—__
*104487*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s450_020_kra:83-1078]]__
Inconvenient.__
*104488*__

Yeah… that’s…__
*104489*__
[[S:::1500-2600]]__
just what I was going to say.__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s450_040_kra:103-2528]]__
Do you remember the way to the Witch’s house?__
*104491*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s450_050_son:13-5257]]__
Yes. The woods with the blood-red leaves, south of the lake. I know just where to go.__
*104492*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s450_060_son:0-2360]]__
Hope she made it back from Alfheim and can bring Mimir back.__
*104493*__
[[S:::3250-3920]]__
He seemed nice,__

[[S:::4890-6000]]__
before you cut off his head.__
*104495*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s341_010_son:68-848]]__
That’s funny…__
*104496*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s341_020_kra:15-680]]__
How so?__
*104497*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s341_030_son:60-1020]]__
One hand wrote__

[[S:::1480-2450]]__
“Jötnar only”__

[[S:::4720-5760]]__
“and also Dwarves.”__

No.__

So this is the bridge to Jötunheim?__

[[S:::1770-3930]]__
I guess Mimir will help us figure out how to get through it…__

[[S:::4300-5500]]__
if we can bring him back to life.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s4554_020_son:0-1540]]__
So this is the bridge to Jötunheim?__
*104513*__
[[S:::2670-5080]]__
This looks like those weird doors we’ve seen.__
*104514*__
[[S:::6130-7870]]__
I guess Mimir will help us figure it all out…__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s010_030_son:40-1250]]__
Right. Right, I know…__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrbr_s020_010_kra:0-500]]__
We jump.__

Oh dear…__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s020_040_son:114-1927]]__
BAD IDEEEEEAAAAAAAA!!!__
*104528*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s050_010_son:130-4200]]__
I can’t believe it was Baldur that came to our house. The Aesir god,__
*104529*__
[[S:::4630-5210]]__
Baldur.__
*104530*__
[[S:::5660-6460]]__
And you fought him…__

[[S:::6712-7413]]__
and won!__
*104532*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrbr_s050_020_kra:40-750]]__
Who is he?__
*104533*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s050_030_son:0-2180]]__
One of Odin’s sons—Thor’s brother.__
*104534*__
[[S:::2492-4343]]__
And now he’s hunting us with his nephews?__
*104535*__
[[S:::4962-5935]]__
Why is this happening?__
*104536*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrbr_s050_040_kra:40-1880]]__
If we can raise the head, you can ask him.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s050_050_son:3-398]]__
Okay.__
*104538*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s050_060_son:76-4315]]__
You know… it’s silly, but I secretly hoped we’d find a Giant somewhere in that mountain.__
*104539*__
[[S:::4713-9371]]__
I guess they really did leave Midgard—except for the serpent. He may be the last of his kind.__
*104540*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s050_070_son:50-1610]]__
Are you the last of your kind, too?__

[[S:::2170-3330]]__
Is that why you don’t like to talk about—__
*104542*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrbr_s050_080_kra:0-750]]__
My kind?__
*104543*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s050_090_son:60-1590]]__
I mean… your family?__

[[S:::2060-2960]]__
Before mother and I.__
*104545*__
[[S:::3460-4400]]__
Where you came from…__
*104546*__
[[S:::4990-5590]]__
a mother?__

A father?__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrbr_s050_100_kra:130-1750]]__
Now is not the time for that.__

Yes, sir.__

[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrbr_s080_010_mmr:0-2250]]__
Well, you gentlemen certainly know how to get around.__
*104551*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s110_010_son:31-2801]]__
Something about this place always makes me feel like I can fly.__
*104552*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrbr_s110_020_mmr:0-4500]]__
It’s disorienting, isn’t it? I strongly suggest NOT leaping into the void, though.__

doesn’t it?__
*104555*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrbr_s130_020_mmr:40-3000]]__
It goes down. Way, WAY down.__

[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrbr_s150_010_mmr:31-2862]]__
Well, I’m pretty sure you weren’t talking to me back there.__

Anything you’d like to get off your chest, brother?__
*104558*__

I can assure you I’m unsurpassed in keeping confidences.__

Well, you know where to find me.__

[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrbr_s150_040_mmr:0-2965]]__
And for the record, I'd already guessed you were Greek.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s170_010_son:17-1162]]__

Hey…__

[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrbr_s200_030_mmr:0-349]]__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrbr_s210_060_kra:0-900]]__

Tell me what?__
*104621*__
[[S:::30154-31488]]__
Did you put this wheel in your mouth?__
*104622*__
[[S:::32608-35867]]__
Oh god, I’ll vomit, I’m not kidding, I’ll throw up on it…__
*104623*__
[[S:::43581-48925]]__
Oh, I can tell you a thing or two about family matters…__
*104624*__
[[S:::54900-57233]]__
Uh… those things are accurate. Your point?__
*104625*__
[[S:::64914-65666]]__
I see…__
*104626*__
[[S:::73071-73681]]__
Umm…__
*104627*__
[[S:::75139-75674]]__
alright…__
*104628*__
[[S:::77770-78447]]__
That hurt a little.__
*104629*__
[[S:::81037-82634]]__
Let’s have a look at your gear then.__
*104630*__
[[S::vo_lvl_fthl04_s450_010_mmr_stem:4700-8250]]__
So, lad… excited to finally see the land of the Giants?__
*104631*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s005_010_son:0-550]]__
Great—__
*104632*__
[[S:::940-2200]]__
I guess they’re all coming to life now.__
*104633*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_fthl04_s005_020_sin:50-1500]]__
Oh look, a different realm,__
*104634*__
[[S:::1920-2878]]__
don’t mind if I do.__
*104635*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s006_010_son:76-2786]]__
They thought that was gonna stop us? Pfft…__
*104636*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s006_020_son:30-1403]]__
Okay, which way up?__
*104637*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s010_010_son:1440-2390]]__
(Sigh) Broken again.__
*104638*__
[[S:::2900-3598]]__
You know…__
*104639*__
[[S:::3680-5310]]__
I’m starting to question Sindri’s skill.__
*104640*__
[[S:::5900-7260]]__
Maybe Brok was right all along.__
*104641*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl04_s020_010_kra:80-2000]]__
Why did you speak to the Dwarf like that?__
*104642*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s020_020_son:51-2150]]__
Aren’t you sick of hearing about him and his brother?__
*104643*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl04_s020_030_kra:30-790]]__
Of course.__
*104644*__
[[S:::1280-3200]]__
But it serves nothing to make an enemy of him.__
*104645*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s020_040_son:0-2000]]__
He should know the truth. Even if it hurts.__
*104646*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl04_s020_050_kra:160-1750]]__
It was needless and unkind.__
*104647*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s020_060_son:65-1908]]__
Truth is more important than kindness.__
*104648*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl04_s020_070_kra:80-1500]]__
Your mother would disagree.__
*104649*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s020_080_son:20-1232]]__
She wasn’t a god.__
*104650*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s030_010_son:16-1849]]__
Why don’t you let me carry her up from here?__
*104651*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl04_s030_020_kra:20-520]]__
No.__
*104652*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s030_030_son:0-3280]]__
Why not? We’re almost there. You know I can handle it!__
*104653*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl04_s030_040_kra:90-690]]__
Can you?__
*104654*__
[[S:::1110-2500]]__
After the way you spoke of her,__
*104655*__
[[S:::3020-4000]]__
I question that.__
*104656*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s030_050_son:0-1250]]__
What, that she wasn’t a god?__
*104657*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl04_s030_060_kra:130-1990]]__
She was better than a god—__
*104658*__
[[S:::2430-4450]]__
and you shall not dishonor her.__
*104659*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s030_070_son:0-2000]]__
Fine. Carry her yourself.__
*104660*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s045_010_son:54-3178]]__
Mimir… if you knew all along that we were gods,__
*104661*__
[[S:::3623-7802]]__
why come up with that story about Odin trying to follow us to Jötunheim before we get there, or whatever?__
*104662*__
[[S:::8264-12608]]__
Isn’t it a lot simpler if they want us dead because we’re gods, and they think we’re a threat?__
*104663*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_fthl04_s045_020_mmr:28-5188]]__
I suppose we can’t rule it out. But Odin’s ways are subtle and his purposes are—__
*104664*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s045_030_son:23-3763]]__
Ugh, enough about Odin and his whole stupid family.__
*104665*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s050_010_son:0-513]]__
Whoa!__
*104666*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s050_020_son:59-2622]]__
Phht… I suppose that’s Odin’s doing too.__
*104667*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s050_030_son:0-650]]__
Nice try!__
*104668*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s060_010_son:0-2110]]__
You and mother always said all gods were evil…__
*104669*__
[[S:::2850-6660]]__
but we’re not! Týr wasn’t. Freya neither. __
*104670*__
[[S:::7510-9090]]__
The Aesir gods - that’s who’s evil.__
*104671*__
[[S:::9800-13240]]__
And you know what—Odin’s right. We are a threat.__
*104672*__
[[S:::13660-15860]]__
Cause we know what they are, and we know we can beat them.__
*104673*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_fthl04_s060_020_mmr:50-1290]]__
Well, not all of them.__
*104674*__
[[S:::1750-2250]]__
Not yet.__
*104675*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s060_030_son:0-2120]]__
Magni did his worst, and he’s dead.__
*104676*__
[[S:::3180-4050]]__
They’re no better than us.__
*104677*__
[[S:::4590-6070]]__
And they’re gonna be sorry they picked this fight.__
*104678*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s010_010_mmr:0-1210]]__
Ahh, Alfheim.__
*104679*__
[[S:::1650-5630]]__
I missed its gentle breeze and the sweet smell of honeysuckle and blood.__
*104680*__
[[S:::6200-6700]]__
Well…__
*104681*__
[[S:::6960-10412]]__
judging by the sky, the Light Elves are in control of the Light this time.__
*104682*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf02_s010_020_kra:19-815]]__
Explain.__
*104683*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s010_030_mmr:0-2750]]__
You see… the Light Elves and Dark Elves—__
*104684*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s010_040_son:0-1460]]__
… are always fighting over the Light.__
*104685*__
[[S:::2240-3000]]__
That part we know.__
*104686*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s010_050_mmr:0-5523]]__
But did you also know that control of the light has changed hands no less than two hundred and thirteen times?__
*104687*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s010_060_son:46-686]]__
Really?!__
*104688*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s010_070_mmr:0-5943]]__
It’s true. Each side believes itself the rightful keepers of the Light and argue they’re simply fighting for survival.__
*104689*__
[[S:::6290-7579]]__
But the fact of the matter is…__
*104690*__
[[S:::7671-10709]]__
the war has been going on so long, they don’t know who they are without it.__
*104691*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s020_010_son:0-740]]__
So…__
*104692*__
[[S:::1260-2230]]__
clear this up for me…__
*104693*__
[[S:::3110-7516]]__
Svartalfheim means “Land of the Dark Elves,” right?__
*104694*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s020_020_mmr:36-602]]__
Right…__
*104695*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s020_030_son:36-3272]]__
But you said the Dark Elves have been here in Alfheim a really long time.__
*104696*__
[[S:::3704-4532]]__
And anyway…__
*104697*__
[[S:::4836-7001]]__
aren’t Dwarves supposed to be from Svartalfheim?__
*104698*__
[[S:::7760-8952]]__
They don’t look like Dark Elves.__
*104699*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s020_040_mmr:16-1019]]__
Don’t you think so?__
*104700*__
[[S:::1146-4439]]__
Then you are vastly more perceptive than the Aesir.__
*104701*__
[[S:::4533-7134]]__
They’re the ones who apparently can’t tell the difference,__
*104702*__
[[S:::7365-9509]]__
and they’re the ones who came up with that name.__
*104703*__
[[S:::10206-12720]]__
Dwarves actually call their home realm “Niðavellir.”__
*104704*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s020_050_son:8-2100]]__
So the Dark Elves aren’t from Svartalfheim at all?__
*104705*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s020_060_mmr:0-2910]]__
Not even a bit. They’re just Elves of another color.__
*104706*__
[[S:::3360-6500]]__
Nobody knows who came first, but they all come from Alfheim.__
*104707*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s020_070_son:0-2160]]__
Why do they fight all the time if they’re really the same?__
*104708*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s020_080_mmr:80-2314]]__
That… is adorable.__
*104709*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s020_090_son:63-665]]__
Huh?__
*104710*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf02_s020_100_kra:50-1500]]__
It is the way of the world.__
*104711*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s020_110_son:0-500]]__
Oh.__
*104712*__
[[S:::960-1470]]__
Well,__
*104713*__
[[S:::2060-2750]]__
that’s sad…__
*104714*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s030_010_son:21-1459]]__
We're going back into the trench again?__
*104715*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s030_020_son:41-705]]__
Lögr__
*104716*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s030_030_mmr:64-569]]__
Huh.__
*104717*__
[[S:::1042-2296]]__
Never knew this was here.__
*104718*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s040_010_mmr:0-1190]]__
Freyr’s Temple—__
*104719*__
[[S:::1980-4750]]__
the ring is just as beautiful as I’d remembered.__
*104720*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf02_s040_020_kra:20-882]]__
Freyr?__
*104721*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s040_030_son:0-750]]__
A Vanir god.__
*104722*__
[[S:::1740-2880]]__
Freya’s brother, actually!__
*104723*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s040_040_mmr:0-2430]]__
Freyr has a long history with the Elves…__
*104724*__
[[S:::2870-4500]]__
one of the few gods welcome here.__
*104725*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s050_010_son:0-520]]__
Father,__
*104726*__
[[S:::1080-1940]]__
after what we did—__
*104727*__
[[S:::2830-4940]]__
giving control of the temple back to the Light Elves—__
*104728*__
[[S:::6180-7400]]__
do you think the war is over?__
*104729*__
[[S:::8290-9500]]__
At least, for a while?__
*104730*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf02_s050_020_kra:20-930]]__
No, Atreus.__
*104731*__
[[S:::1430-3550]]__
The Dark Elves may have scattered for now,__
*104732*__
[[S:::4010-5650]]__
but some other will rise to lead them,__
*104733*__
[[S:::6350-8250]]__
and they will surely attack again.__
*104734*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s050_030_mmr:0-1500]]__
Afraid your da’s right, son.__
*104735*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s050_040_son:96-833]]__
I see.__
*104736*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl09_s010_010_mmr:190-3000]]__
Now straight back to Týr’s Temple to find that Black Rune.__
*104737*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s010_020_son:190-3460]]__
But there’s still so much we haven’t explored. And I’m a god now!__
*104738*__
[[S:::3980-10300]]__
(Gasps) Wait, is that why I can hear thoughts sometimes? Like in Alfheim? Can you hear voices too?__
*104739*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl09_s010_030_kra:25-694]]__
I cannot.__
*104741*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s010_040_son:60-1690]]__
Did you always know you were a god?__
*104742*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl09_s010_050_kra:44-510]]__
No.__
*104743*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s010_060_son:70-1030]]__
How did you find out?__
*104744*__
[[S:::1410-2250]]__
Did your father tell you?__
*104745*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl09_s010_070_mmr:150-2380]]__
Atreus, lad—a question for you first:__
*104746*__
[[S:::3000-6500]]__
Why do you suppose the World Serpent didn’t just tell us the Black Rune?__
*104747*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s010_080_son:90-2150]]__
Oh. You’re right! Why didn’t he?__
*104748*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl09_s010_090_mmr:160-2310]]__
Different language. Different alphabet.__
*104749*__
[[S:::3000-4360]]__
Nothing comes easy, does it?__
*104750*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s010_100_son:0-740]]__
I’m a god now. Let’__
*104751*__
[[S:::1190-1750]]__
s find out.__
*104752*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s014_010_son:194-1800]]__
Is this why I hear voices sometimes?__
*104753*__
[[S:::2570-4000]]__
You sure you’ve never heard any?__
*104754*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl09_s014_020_kra:130-1000]]__
Not as you do.__
*104755*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl09_s014_030_mmr:110-3095]]__
That’s no surprise. Every god is unique.__
*104756*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s014_040_son:130-810]]__
So…__
*104757*__
[[S:::1250-5000]]__
maybe I won’t get strong like father… but I’ll have abilities all my own?__
*104758*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl09_s014_050_mmr:180-1642]]__
You already do, laddy!__
*104759*__
[[S:::2030-5477]]__
Your faculty for language is extraordinary for one so young.__
*104760*__
[[S:::5895-9139]]__
Time alone will tell what else you’ll become capable of.__
*104761*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s014_060_son:273-1250]]__
So… you knew all along.__
*104762*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl09_s014_070_mmr:90-980]]__
I did, lad.__
*104763*__
[[S:::1340-3500]]__
But I’ve known more than my share of gods.__
*104764*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s014_080_son:131-990]]__
Me too, apparently.__
*104765*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s016_010_son:100-1600]]__
I wonder who else knew I was a god…__
*104766*__
[[S:::2300-3130]]__
Freya for sure…__
*104767*__
[[S:::3730-4480]]__
Brok and Sindri?__
*104768*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl09_s016_020_kra:140-1500]]__
They do not need to know.__
*104769*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s016_030_son:72-7993]]__
(gasps) Baldur! Does he know? Is that why he’s after us? Do you know him from before?__
*104770*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl09_s016_040_kra:180-3530]]__
The day of your mother’s funeral was the first I ever saw Baldur.__

[[S:::4570-5500]]__
That is the truth.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s020_010_son:70-3570]]__
Hey—we don’t have to go right back to Týr’s Vault, do we?__

[[S:::4440-7990]]__
I mean… we’re Gods! We can do whatever we want, right?__

The bowl’s answer?__

In plain sight?__
*104790*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s040d_020_son:0-749]]__
It says “Earth.”__
*104791*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl09_s040e_010_kra:38-1283]]__
Is that the answer there?__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s040e_020_son:33-992]]__

for what you did to Magni.__

[[S:::11140-12070]]__
My own father__

[[S:::51752-60080]]__
Hehehehe... that’s what I said to your mother... Right before I gave it to her.__

Move it or we’ll pick up where he left off.__

[[S:::39300-41542]]__
He should pay for what he said about mother.__

[[S:::47587-51516]]__

No.__

[[S:::35270-36090]]__
He is beaten—__

not worth killing.__

[[S:::41580-43350]]__

[[S:::63140-64300]]__

[[S:::74170-76200]]__
You killed against my wishes.__

[[S:::77350-78470]]__
You lost control.__

[[S:::81860-83830]]__
I have been teaching you to survive.__
*104830*__
[[S:::85080-86330]]__
We are gods, boy...__
*104831*__
[[S:::87640-89100]]__
and that makes us a target.__

[[S:::89730-91600]]__
From now until the end of days,__

[[S:::92060-93000]]__
you are marked.__

[[S:::94103-96660]]__
So I teach you to kill, yes...__
*104835*__
[[S:::97245-101335]]__
but in defense of yourself. Never as an indulgence.__
*104836*__
[[S:::106364-109020]]__
There are consequences to killing a god.__

[[S:::114660-119362]]__
Watch your tone, boy.__
*104838*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp02_s470_010_son_stem:7120-7670]]__
Wow.__

Jötunheim.__

[[S:::38131-39955]]__
No! I’m a god too!__

[[S:::22340-22940]]__
Brother! Look ou—__

[[S:::51440-54244]]__
Baldur. Let ’em go. Take me instead. I’ll do whatever you—__
*104853*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp02_s470_010_bld_stem:26081-27563]]__

[[S:::55792-58238]]__
All this time, I thought I needed you!__

[[S:::59640-61569]]__
But, you’re just meat!__

[[S:::62717-65272]]__
Turns out, the boy is the brains!__

[[S:::84788-90404]]__
Oh, you stupid son of a bitch!__
*104860*__
[[S:::95992-103423]]__
Yes… by all means, junior, run away. Let daddy do all the heavy lifting for you.__
*104861*__
[[S:::121196-124018]]__
And here I thought my family was fucked up…__
*104862*__
[[S:::129023-131343]]__
Aww… your father is right boy.__
*104863*__
[[S:::131343-133389]]__
You are far from ready.__
*104864*__
[[S:::133389-136313]]__
Now, would you be so kind as to hold this for me?__
*104865*__
[[S:::137865-138382]]__
Thank you.__
*104866*__
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp02_s470_010_kra_stem:35101-36302]]__
Run, boy!__

Cross the bridge!__
*104868*__
[[S:::69221-71743]]__
RAAAAAA!__

[[S:::93873-95263]]__
Get out of here, boy!__
*104870*__
[[S:::107013-108061]]__
Calm DOWN, boy!__
*104871*__
[[S:::108502-109600]]__
You are NOT ready for this.__

[[S:::113005-114200]]__
Boy… I…__

What do you need that for?__
*104875*__
[[S:::1640-2460]]__
We did that already.__
*104876*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s020_010_son:40-1160]]__
Why are we going this way?__
*104877*__
[[S:::1880-3000]]__
Did we miss something back here?__
*104878*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s030_010_son:50-2500]]__
Maybe I should have rolled Modi in there with all the other dead guys…__
*104879*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s030_020_son:0-550]]__
What?__
*104880*__
[[S:::990-3000]]__
You feel like crawling on top of dead bodies again?__
*104881*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s040_010_son:0-2000]]__
Pretty sure there’s nothing else for us here.__
*104882*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s050_010_son:100-2250]]__
Can we go back to the room with the stag statue now?__
*104883*__
[[S:::2850-3750]]__
This is pointless!__
*104884*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp02_s060_010_kra:90-4500]]__
Keep your wits about you, boy. If Modi found us, Baldur cannot be far.__
*104885*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s060_020_son:10-500]]__
Good.__
*104886*__
[[S:::1010-2290]]__
I have a few words for him too…__
*104887*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp02_s060_030_kra:50-1100]]__
No, you do not.__
*104888*__
[[S:::1450-2500]]__
You will leave him to me.__
*104889*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s060_040_son:60-1200]]__
So you can kill him.__
*104890*__
[[S:::1810-5750]]__
’Cause that’s what we do to our enemies. RIGHT? Cause he’d do the same to us?__
*104891*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp02_s060_050_kra:80-2250]]__
I will do only what is necessary.__
*104892*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s060_060_son:50-750]]__
And I’ll help.__

[[S:::1030-1600]]__
this room.__

[[S:::2320-3250]]__
But we need a new way up.__
*104897*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s080_010_son:20-2250]]__
You know there’s no way up this way, right?__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp02_s090_005_kra:10-888]]__

Even if we could take the cart up, the next platform broke when we fought the dragon.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s100_010_son:20-1458]]__
I can’t learn if you won’t teach me.__

You do not heed my lessons.__

Why did you hide them?__
*104906*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s100_060_son:50-2270]]__
You said there are consequences to killing a god.__

You used the blades to kill one?__
*104908*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s100_070_son:0-2160]]__
Who else did you kill, before Magni?__
*104909*__

How many?__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s100_080_son:170-900]]__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl11_s010_020_son:110-4470]]__
That key has gotta be for that crazy door downstairs, hidden around the back. Remember?__
*104968*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl11_s010_021_mmr:90-3250]]__
And beyond that, hopefully some trace of a secret path to Jötunheim!__
*104969*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl11_s010_030_son:110-2480]]__
Now we just need to figure out what door this key opens.__
*104970*__
[[S:::3230-4750]]__
It has to be somewhere around the temple…__
*104971*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl11_s010_040_mmr:0-3250]]__
And beyond that, hopefully some trace of a secret path to Jötunheim!__
*104972*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl11_s020_010_son:50-2320]]__
Oh, you’re right—now that we’ve got the key,__
*104973*__
[[S:::2320-5110]]__
we can open that big door any time we want. Let’s explore!__
*104974*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s350_010_sin_stem:2660-6669]]__
Wow, that was… uh... something, that uh, fight.__
*104975*__
[[S:::7230-8603]]__
Here, catch!__
*104976*__
[[S:::10080-12000]]__
Well that was a waste of a perfectly good apple.__
*104977*__
[[S:::15970-18363]]__
Oh. That.__
*104978*__
[[S:::19626-24136]]__
It's a little trick my people can pull. A special way of not being seen.__
*104979*__
[[S:::26430-33041]]__
More like I can step into the realm between realms...and your mind doesn't understand what it’s seeing, so__
*104980*__
[[S:::33621-35236]]__
it sees nothing at all.__
*104981*__
[[S:::35585-39366]]__
That’s how we avoid ever having to actually use the weapons we craft.__
*104982*__
[[S:::42670-47055]]__
It, uh…it doesn’t seem to work on dragons though.__
*104983*__
[[S:::52248-57376]]__
Brok was asking about me? Was there mead on his breath?__
*104984*__
[[S:::63846-66067]]__
You let him touch this again.__
*104985*__
[[S:::76362-77995]]__
Come on then...__
*104986*__
[[S:::88630-93421]]__
Okay, now shush! I need complete silence for this…__
*104987*__
[[S:::96477-97713]]__
There ya go!__
*104988*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s350_010_kra_stem:12006-13527]]__
How were you not seen?__
*104989*__
[[S:::13900-16377]]__
There is nowhere here to hide.__
*104990*__
[[S:::97621-100266]]__
Rrrr.__
*104991*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s350_010_son_stem:24390-26044]]__
You can be invisible?__
*104992*__
[[S:::47310-49731]]__
Your brother wanted to know if you were getting enough to eat.__
*104993*__
[[S:::50242-51839]]__
I guess I can tell him you are!__
*104994*__
[[S:::83179-88350]]__
So that’s how Brok was in the temple right after the water dropped. He stepped between realms!__
*104995*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s355a_010_son_stem:4178-4965]]__
Yes, sir.__
*104996*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s355a_010_kra_stem:534-994]]__
Ready?__
*104997*__
[[S:::1840-3756]]__
Dig in and push with everything.__
*104998*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s355b_010_son_stem:4548-6000]]__
How do we get down?__
*104999*__
[[S:::6768-7664]]__
Really?__
*105000*__
[[S:::15931-17508]]__
Why would I panic?!__
*105001*__
[[S:::17755-18558]]__
Whoa!!__
*105002*__
[[S:::39987-40668]]__
Uh huh.__
*105003*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s355b_010_kra_stem:6000-6768]]__
We jump!__
*105004*__
[[S:::7664-8353]]__
Come!__
*105005*__
[[S:::14564-15900]]__
Do not panic!__
*105006*__
[[S:::19843-21331]]__
I have you!__
*105007*__
[[S:::38642-39930]]__
You are well?__
*105008*__
[[S:::40668-43017]]__
Good. We should keep moving.__
*105009*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s355b_010_mmr_stem:35630-37450]]__
You’re cracked, you know that?__
*105010*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s358_010_mmr_stem:3150-3750]]__
Hurry, brother.__
*105011*__
[[S:::4130-7200]]__
We may get a piece of the chisel and be gone before they even notice.__
*105012*__
[[S:::12045-12933]]__
Uh oh.__
*105013*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s358_010_mgi_stem:12900-15624]]__
You.__
*105014*__
[[S:::20110-24325]]__
Surrender. The Allfather demands it.__
*105015*__
[[S:::29451-30840]]__
Good.__
*105016*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s358_010_kra_stem:16581-17396]]__
Boy—__
*105017*__
[[S:::24556-25335]]__
No.__
*105018*__
[[S:::31830-34429]]__
This fight is mine, boy. GO.__
*105019*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s358_010_mdi_stem:37810-39520]]__
And where do you think you’re goin’?__
*105020*__
[[S:::40400-41830]]__
Oh no. Brother!__
*105021*__
[[S:::42300-47174]]__
The little freak’s got a bow! What are we gonna do?__
*105022*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s360_010_mdi_stem:300-1343]]__
Magni!__
*105023*__
[[S:::2059-2924]]__
NO—!!__
*105024*__
[[S:::4938-5615]]__
How did you…?__
*105025*__
[[S:::7187-8893]]__
You have no idea what…__
*105026*__
[[S:::9279-10493]]__
You son of a bitch!__
*105027*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s360_010_son_stem:10500-11381]]__
You’re next!__
*105028*__
[[S:::11653-13710]]__
Come back, you damn coward!__
*105029*__
[[S:::13867-15394]]__
I’ll rip your head off!!__
*105030*__
[[S:::32640-33200]]__
No!__
*105031*__
[[S:::35100-36300]]__
It hasn’t…__
*105032*__
[[S:::41600-42861]]__
NO.__
*105033*__
[[S:::50220-50980]]__
I’ll be alright…__
*105034*__
[[S:::56665-57910]]__
I’m fine. See?__
*105035*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s360_010_kra_stem:26309-27303]]__
The sickness…__
*105036*__
[[S:::28470-29804]]__
the fever has returned.__
*105037*__
[[S:::36320-36720]]__
Boy…__
*105038*__
[[S:::45630-46400]]__
Steady…__
*105039*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s360_010_mmr_stem:38330-39670]]__
The coughing… the blood…__
*105040*__
[[S:::40200-41590]]__
The boy’s sick. He needs Freya.__
*105041*__
[[S:::52430-53250]]__
There you go, lad…__
*105042*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s020_010_kra:0-750]]__
We seek a chisel?__
*105043*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s020_020_mmr:0-1200]]__
The tip of one, yes…__
*105044*__
[[S:::1690-3750]]__
a very, very giant chisel.__
*105045*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s030_010_mmr:0-1750]]__
Magically sealed, I’m afraid.__
*105046*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s040_010_son:11-2132]]__
That big crystal on the Giant’s ring looks promising…__
*105047*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s040_020_mmr:0-2250]]__
Brother, looks like that crystal’s brimming again.__
*105048*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s040_030_son:1-2006]]__
Darn. That didn’t seem to do anything.__
*105049*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s040_040_mmr:0-1500]]__
Ooo. Neat trick, lad.__
*105050*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s040_050_son:0-470]]__
Thanks.__
*105051*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s040_060_son:8-717]]__
His idea.__
*105052*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s050_010_son:11-1127]]__
What happened to the survivors?__
*105053*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s050_010_son_a:11-1127]]__
What happened to the survivors?__
*105054*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s050_020_mmr:50-2850]]__
Oh, Thamur was a Frost Giant.__
*105055*__
[[S:::3210-5750]]__
When he died, his final breath froze everything.__
*105056*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s060_010_son:10-775]]__
There he is…__
*105057*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s060_020_mmr:0-1506]]__
Find the tip of that chisel.__
*105058*__
[[S:::1702-2800]]__
That’s the magic we need.__
*105059*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s070_010_son:0-1040]]__
An Alfheim light crystal.__
*105060*__
[[S:::1670-2250]]__
Wonder what it’s for?__
*105061*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s070_020_son:3-1468]]__
The crystal! There it is!__
*105062*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s080_010_son:0-2470]]__
A light crystal base? But where’s the crystal?__
*105063*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s080_020_son:0-1624]]__
Well here’s the base for the crystal we saw.__
*105064*__
[[S:::2100-2702]]__
But...__
*105065*__
[[S:::2760-3575]]__
how do we get it down?__
*105066*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s090_010_son:7-2702]]__
Hey! Hardened world tree sap. That’s handy.__
*105067*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s100_010_son:1-419]]__
That did it!__
*105068*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s105_010_son:0-2000]]__
“To Njörd we offer back the sea’s bounty.”__
*105069*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s105_020_mmr:160-4710]]__
Ah, yes. It was believed that Njörd calmed the winds and seas for the fishermen.__
*105070*__
[[S:::5190-7250]]__
For that, they loved and worshipped him here.__
*105071*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s110_010_son:0-750]]__
How we getting down there?__
*105072*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s110_020_kra:0-750]]__
I have a plan.__
*105073*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s110_030_mmr:5-608]]__
You do?__
*105074*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s110_040_kra:0-1250]]__
Do not act so surprised.__
*105075*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s110_050_mmr:120-970]]__
No offense, brother,__
*105076*__
[[S:::1350-5000]]__
but I don’t even think Thor with Mjölnir in hand could get through that much ice.__
*105077*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s110_060_kra:2-1380]]__
Then Thor is a fool.__
*105078*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s110_070_mmr:0-1000]]__
This should be entertaining…__
*105079*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s110_080_kra:0-470]]__
Boy.__
*105080*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s110_090_son:8-351]]__
Ready.__
*105081*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s120_010_son:5-1431]]__
Look! Is that Sindri up there?__
*105082*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_smc01_s120_020_sin:70-1510]]__
Oh, hey.__
*105083*__
[[S:::1980-2870]]__
You again!__
*105084*__
[[S:::3410-4170]]__
Come on up!__
*105085*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s140_003_son:0-1500]]__
So! This plan of yours…__
*105086*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s140_004_kra:0-690]]__
Can you guess it?__
*105087*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s140_005_son:0-616]]__
Knowing you,__
*105088*__
[[S:::862-2250]]__
it doesn’t involve standing around here.__
*105089*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s140_006_kra:15-607]]__
Correct.__
*105090*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s140_007_son:22-1168]]__
But how do we move forward?__
*105091*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s140_010_son:0-2250]]__
Boy. Thamur really liked jewelry didn’t he?__
*105092*__
[[S:::2845-4163]]__
He even braided his beard with it.__
*105093*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s140_020_mmr:0-2590]]__
I happen to think he looks dashing…__
*105094*__
[[S:::3010-4180]]__
you know… for a snow-covered corpse.__
*105095*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s140_030_son:0-2500]]__
Wait, there’s one of those shatter crystals in his jewelry.__
*105096*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_smc01_s140_040_sin:73-2489]]__
Careful! My shop’s RIGHT HERE!__
*105097*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s150_010_son:0-990]]__
We heading into that building?__
*105098*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s150_020_kra:4-445]]__
Yes.__
*105099*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s150_030_son:12-3273]]__
You think there’s something inside that’ll help us break the ice and get to the chisel tip?__
*105100*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s150_040_kra:0-394]]__
No.__
*105101*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s150_050_son:10-1656]]__
Hmm… I’ll keep thinking.__
*105102*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s160_010_son:0-500]]__
Mimir.__
*105103*__
[[S:::910-1710]]__
You knew this place?__
*105104*__
[[S:::2050-2525]]__
Before?__
*105105*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s160_020_mmr:0-4960]]__
Aye, came here on a diplomatic mission once, trying to broker a peace between Asgard and Vanaheim.__
*105106*__
[[S:::5800-6330]]__
That war—__
*105107*__
[[S:::7030-8330]]__
so many lives lost.__
*105108*__
[[S:::9290-13204]]__
What I didn’t know was Thor had already gone on a killing spree of Giants.__
*105109*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s160_030_son:9-2361]]__
What did the Giants have to do with the war between the gods?__
*105110*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s160_040_mmr:0-3040]]__
Nothing at all, lad, that’s the tragedy of it.__
*105111*__
[[S:::3590-5510]]__
They took no side in that madness…__
*105112*__
[[S:::6410-10250]]__
but Odin’s paranoia is surpassed only by Thor’s lust for blood.__
*105113*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s170_010_son:1-1748]]__
Another crystal… just give the word.__
*105114*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s170_020_son:22-1316]]__
Huh. What now?__
*105115*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s170_030_son:180-1698]]__
Ooh, we got most of it…__
*105116*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s170_040_mmr:0-530]]__
Well!__
*105117*__
[[S:::990-2250]]__
A stealthy plan it is not.__
*105118*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s170_050_kra:60-1500]]__
Now we must free the other strap.__
*105119*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s170_060_son:17-537]]__
We do?__
*105120*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s170_070_kra:0-500]]__
We do.__
*105121*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s180_010_son:0-2190]]__
Why are we going up when what we need is all the way down there?__
*105122*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s180_020_kra:10-522]]__
Think.__
*105123*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s180_030_son:0-500]]__
Well…__
*105124*__
[[S:::1100-4380]]__
the chisel tip is under thick layers of ice, so melting it won’t work.__
*105125*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s180_040_kra:5-475]]__
Correct.__
*105126*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s180_050_son:1-4057]]__
And there weren’t any Shatter Crystals nearby for me to shoot, so that’s not an option.__
*105127*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s180_060_kra:1-493]]__
Correct.__
*105128*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s180_070_son:0-6770]]__
That just leaves smashing the ice. But we’d need something ridiculously heavy to—Ohhhhh. I get it now.__
*105129*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s180_080_kra:2-511]]__
Good.__
*105130*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s190_010_son:8-2586]]__
How are we going to turn the hammer so it lands near the chisel tip?__
*105131*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s190_020_kra:0-910]]__
Not possible.__
*105132*__
[[S:::1300-5250]]__
We cut it free, ride it down, and figure out what comes next after.__
*105133*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s190_030_son:0-2000]]__
So your plan involves a whole bunch of luck then.__
*105134*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s190_040_kra:0-2340]]__

The chisel tip!__

Ugh. I fucking hate Midgard.__

How do we know they’re even here?__
*105337*__
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s250_030_mgi:117-2699]]__
Because that hammer didn’t fall on its own.__

Not now.__

Aye.__

[[S:::980-2440]]__
Magni and Modi—__

[[S:::2830-4000]]__
the sons of Thor.__
*105348*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s260_030_son:0-3850]]__
Mother always said the Aesir were the worst of the gods, and Thor was the worst of the Aesir.__

Look—the chisel tip’s just ahead.__
*105367*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s276_010_son:60-1570]]__
I think this is Njörd’s own mark.__

The god they worshipped came to dinner?__

[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s276_020_mmr:39-5551]]__
Sounds like Njörd to me. Affable fellow, formidable drinker. The Vanir always were a more__

personable sort of god than the Aesir.__

He went to war with Uncle and walked away.__

Well, as long as father believes him, so do we.__

You should have died with the rest of your kind.__

not one of my strong points.__

We should keep an eye on him.__

Enough?__
*105776*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s340_020_mmr:120-660]]__
Should do.__
*105777*__
[[S:::1230-5410]]__
With that, we can carve the travel rune to Jötunheim—get you where you need to go.__
*105778*__
[[S:::6140-9997]]__
Incidentally, all those magically-sealed doors we’ve seen can now be unlocked…__

like that one around the corner.__
*105780*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s340_030_mmr:0-2250]]__
You can get through that door there, now that you got the chisel.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s355_010_son:0-1675]]__
You…killed Magni.__

That he did.__
*105783*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s355_030_son:18-2490]]__
He was a god… but you killed him.__
*105784*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s355_040_mmr:40-2250]]__
Minor Aesir, perhaps, but aye…__
*105785*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s355_050_son:17-1317]]__
And his father is Thor…__
*105786*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s355_060_mmr:100-720]]__
Not Minor.__
*105787*__
[[S:::1270-2910]]__
Not Minor at all, him.__
*105788*__
[[S:::3750-6250]]__
This will not go over well in Asgard.__
*105789*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s355_070_kra:150-2150]]__
I defended us. Nothing more.__

I fear no judgment.__

[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s355_080_mmr:70-1500]]__
Judgment, no,__
*105792*__
[[S:::2040-3750]]__
but if vengeance is any concern…__
*105793*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s355_090_son:0-3044]]__

Yes sir.__

Door…__
*105802*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s370_020_son:1440-2600]]__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s370_020_son_a:6-1518]]__

Brother…__
*105805*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s370_040_kra:0-750]]__
I know.__
*105806*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s374_010_son:0-2893]]__
Wait, we were here before. But which way back?__
*105807*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s357_010_son:0-500]]__
Hey…__
*105808*__
[[S:::1080-1940]]__
I just realized…__
*105809*__
[[S:::2680-4197]]__
Magni didn’t come back to life.__
*105810*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_smc01_s357_020_mmr:20-1679]]__
That is interesting.__
*105811*__
[[S:::2360-4949]]__
It’s known the Aesir find their own way to Valhalla.__
*105812*__
[[S:::5168-8392]]__
No Valkyrie escort, no processing at the gates of Helheim.__
*105813*__
[[S:::8760-10000]]__
That may be significant…__
*105814*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s380_010_mmr:0-950]]__
Behind you, brother.__
*105815*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s390_010_son:0-1856]]__
Look—we’re back near the giant’s hand.__
*105816*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s390_010_son_a:14-1955]]__
Look—we’re back near the Giant’s hand.__
*105817*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s390_020_son:8-381]]__
What…__
*105818*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s390_030_son:940-1750]]__
… what is this place?__
*105819*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s390_030_son_a:8-1021]]__
… what is this place?__
*105820*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s390_040_mmr:0-4050]]__
Fishermen would bring the day’s catch into this port and use that contraption to send some of it__
*105821*__
[[S:::4050-5890]]__
directly to the jarl’s main kitchen.__
*105822*__
[[S:::6490-8000]]__
The rest were sorted and sold.__
*105823*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s390_050_kra:0-1590]]__
There is an exit under the thumb.__
*105824*__
[[S:::2030-3000]]__
Find a way across.__
*105825*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s400_010_son:0-602]]__
It’s moving.__
*105826*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s400_020_son:1-1390]]__
(coughs)__
*105827*__
[[S:::2050-3682]]__
Maybe we… can reach it.__
*105828*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s410_010_kra:0-890]]__
There is an opening.__
*105829*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s410_020_son:0-500]]__
I can get it.__
*105830*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s420_010_son:0-440]]__
Oh no…__
*105831*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s420_020_son:0-1790]]__
It’s moving back.__
*105832*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s420_020_son_a:2-809]]__
It’s moving back.__
*105833*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s420_030_son:2-814]]__
I think that did it.__
*105834*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s420_040_son:10-2033]]__
There’s a rope up here. (coughs)__
*105835*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s420_050_son:3-2298]]__
There’s a path to the exit… on the other side.__
*105836*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s430_010_mmr:0-960]]__
Back under his palm.__
*105837*__
[[S:::1520-2250]]__
We’re almost there.__
*105838*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s435_010_son:0-1097]]__
Everything we just did…__
*105839*__
[[S:::1580-2823]]__
climbed around a dead giant,__
*105840*__
[[S:::3160-4503]]__
rode a giant falling hammer,__
*105841*__
[[S:::4840-7669]]__
fought some bad gods. What do you think mother would say?__
*105842*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s435_020_kra:40-1500]]__
That you have come a long way.__
*105843*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s435_030_son:3-440]]__
Thanks.__
*105844*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s450_010_mmr:160-940]]__
What now then?__
*105845*__
[[S:::1700-3683]]__
Maybe Freya ought to have a look at the boy.__
*105846*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s450_020_kra:0-1000]]__
Unnecessary.__
*105847*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s450_030_son:0-1290]]__
Yeah, I feel better now.__
*105848*__
[[S:::1870-3930]]__
I just needed to catch my breath. Honestly.__
*105849*__
[[S:::4840-5600]]__
So what’s next?__
*105850*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s450_040_mmr:170-990]]__
Okay, well…__
*105851*__
[[S:::1440-5770]]__
now that we have the magic of the chisel, we can write the secret travel rune to Jötunheim.__
*105852*__
[[S:::6540-7200]]__
Except…__
*105853*__
[[S:::7590-8331]]__
we don’t know it.__
*105854*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s450_050_son:0-1814]]__
What? Didn’t you ask the World Serpent?__
*105855*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s450_060_mmr:196-953]]__
I did!__
*105856*__
[[S:::1442-2578]]__
But he didn’t know it either.__
*105857*__
[[S:::3325-7406]]__
He did, however, tell me the one person the Giants did entrust with that secret.__
*105858*__
[[S:::7735-9889]]__
And that person was none other than Týr.__
*105859*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s450_070_son:9-750]]__
Isn’t Týr dead?__
*105860*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s450_080_mmr:0-1700]]__
Long gone, it’s true.__
*105861*__
[[S:::2210-6310]]__
But his hidden vault—where he kept his most prized possessions and secrets—__
*105862*__
[[S:::6670-12418]]__
still exists, undisturbed and hidden underwater for a hundred and forty-odd winters.__
*105863*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s450_090_son:0-670]]__
His temple?__
*105864*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s450_100_mmr:75-854]]__
That’s right, lad.__
*105865*__
[[S:::1093-4538]]__
He secretly built his vault underneath the realm travel temple.__
*105866*__
[[S:::4800-8661]]__
Somewhere inside, we’ll find the Black Rune, and we’ll get you to Jötunheim.__
*105867*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s450_110_son:0-1543]]__
We could also explore some more.__
*105868*__
[[S:::2190-3219]]__
We got that chisel now,__
*105869*__
[[S:::3610-5004]]__
and that vault isn’t going anywhere.__
*105870*__
[[S:::5550-6981]]__
Seems a shame to waste this boat...__
*105871*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s450_120_kra:10-1211]]__
We shall see, boy.__
*105872*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s350_010_mmr:0-4794]]__
Hidden inside that tablet is a mystical rune that creates the magical seal keeping that door locked.__
*105873*__
[[S:::5044-9317]]__
Use our chisel to find the binding points of the hidden rune so we can dispel it.__
*105874*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s350_020_mmr:0-1960]]__
Hover the chisel over the face of the tablet.__
*105875*__
[[S:::2310-4750]]__
When you’ve found the hidden rune, you’ll feel something.__
*105876*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s350_030_mmr:0-800]]__
Trouble finding it?__
*105877*__
[[S:::1250-2250]]__
Keep trying then.__
*105878*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s350_040_mmr:8-3953]]__
You’ll feel a mystical pulse when the hidden rune senses the chisel over it.__
*105879*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s350_050_mmr:0-1960]]__
You found it. Now dispel it!__
*105880*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s350_060_mmr:32-1959]]__
That’s it, brother! Dispel it!__
*105881*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s350_070_mmr:0-1450]]__
Aaaaand you’ve lost it.__
*105882*__
[[S:::1920-2750]]__
Try again, brother.__
*105883*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s350_080_mmr:70-1190]]__
You almost had it.__
*105884*__
[[S:::1550-2150]]__
Keep looking…__
*105885*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s350_090_mmr:0-3010]]__
Now the mystical rune’s been dispelled and the seal broken.__
*105886*__
[[S:::3650-5750]]__
You just used the magic of the Giants!__
*105887*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsm1_s010_010_son:2-743]]__
Thor killed him.__
*105888*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsm1_s010_020_son:0-460]]__
Oh, no…__
*105889*__
[[S:::1230-2181]]__
he fell on a village?__
*105890*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsm1_s010_030_mmr:0-500]]__
Aye.__
*105891*__
[[S:::1240-5920]]__
When Thamur fell, he crushed a charming place famed for worshipping the Vanir god, Njörd.__
*105892*__
[[S:::6610-8740]]__
Thor always took credit for planning that one, but__
*105893*__
[[S:::9210-11500]]__
the truth is the sweaty bawbag just got lucky.__
*105897*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s490_010_brk_stem:1780-3702]]__
Who’s activated the bridge?__
*105898*__
[[S:::3800-6149]]__
Hey! I asked you a question—__
*105899*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s490_010_bld_stem:11120-12538]]__
Too late,__
*105900*__
[[S:::12600-14382]]__
it’s locked in.__
*105901*__
[[S:::16390-21320]]__
And when the bridge opens, the full weight of Asgard will come crashing down on you.__
*105902*__
[[S:::24473-25856]]__
It’s over.__
*105903*__
[[S:::47315-50772]]__
Let go of it now or I will kill him. You know I will.__
*105904*__
[[S:::56780-59299]]__
What did you do…?__
*105905*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s490_010_kra_stem:26000-26872]]__
Is it?__
*105906*__
[[S:::34928-35883]]__
So be it.__
*105907*__
[[S:::43803-45873]]__
NO! Listen to me!__
*105908*__
[[S:::61411-62297]]__
BOY!!__
*105909*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s490_010_son_stem:43031-43803]]__
BALDUR!__
*105910*__
[[S:::46312-47315]]__
Let me help!__
*105911*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s510_010_kra_stem:1670-2340]]__
Can you make it?__
*105912*__
[[S:::146100-148032]]__
We have work to do.__
*105913*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s510_010_brk_stem:5038-6374]]__
Is it a weapon?__
*105914*__
[[S:::7118-12848]]__
Armor? Or likewise an instrument of war of which I’m a master at shapin’?__
*105915*__
[[S:::13378-14103]]__
No?__
*105916*__
[[S:::14327-15706]]__
Then forget it.__
*105917*__
[[S:::15826-18962]]__
Even if I wanted to make such an insignificant gewgaw,__
*105918*__
[[S:::19177-24295]]__
I’m liable to chink my tools working something so delicate and ladylike.__
*105919*__
[[S:::30677-32425]]__
Okay, smart guy.__
*105920*__
[[S:::32550-36454]]__
And where d’ya propose to find a lump of quality skap slag?__
*105921*__
[[S:::36466-40288]]__
Last time I saw one, I could still get rigid down south.__
*105922*__
[[S:::42562-48187]]__
Shut your mouth. Is that…? Where did you…?__
*105923*__
[[S:::52632-58100]]__
(laughter) Well, don’t just stand there—let’s do this!__
*105924*__
[[S:::63168-65587]]__
Ah hell… why not?__
*105925*__
[[S:::66612-69986]]__
What? I can grow too…__
*105926*__
[[S:::75535-79403]]__
YOU keep your wrist loose. I need more heat here!__
*105927*__
[[S:::82100-86838]]__
I don’t need to—I triple-quenched it with Draugr oil. See?__
*105928*__
[[S:::96632-97900]]__
No, its not!__
*105929*__
[[S:::102100-104145]]__
Nope! Don’t forget this!__
*105930*__
[[S:::119856-124136]]__
Oh, quit yer grinning. It’s downright unsettlin’ hrmm.__
*105931*__
[[S:::130450-134646]]__
Yeah, price of uh.. reforging something what broke.__
*105932*__
[[S:::137300-140813]]__
Oh, cut it out, princess. You’re gonna get me all weepy.__
*105933*__
[[S:::157237-159699]]__
Ohhhh…__
*105934*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s510_010_sin_stem:23985-25000]]__
Then shingle it.__
*105935*__
[[S:::25900-29950]]__
Pattern weld the item with skap slag. Keep the layers thin, alternate the overlay.__
*105936*__
[[S:::48610-53100]]__
I had to get my hands dirty. (gags)__
*105937*__
[[S:::58240-61910]]__
What? You? You’re fine with working on something that’s not a weapon?__
*105938*__
[[S:::72010-73660]]__
Oh, watch the spine.__
*105939*__
[[S:::74160-75100]]__
Keep your wrist loose.__
*105940*__
[[S:::79405-79900]]__
Coming up.__
*105941*__
[[S:::80460-82030]]__
You going to temper that steel longer?__
*105942*__
[[S:::86900-88879]]__
Oh, how inventive. And sanitary!__
*105943*__
[[S:::90532-95810]]__
You clever little beaver! Never too late to learn a new trick, is it?__
*105944*__
[[S:::101215-102000]]__
Here it is!__
*105945*__
[[S:::141625-145300]]__
I like the new one better, don’t you?__
*105946*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s510_010_son_stem:124427-126530]]__
It’s just nice to see you together.__
*105947*__
[[S:::127458-128190]]__
But…__
*105948*__
[[S:::128432-130439]]__
now the rune on your brand looks different.__
*105949*__
[[S:::134211-135632]]__
I knew it.__
*105950*__
[[S:::135681-137200]]__
You two love each other.__
*105951*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s515_010_kra_stem:4616-5360]]__
Boy,__
*105952*__
[[S:::5660-6280]]__
your knife.__
*105953*__
[[S:::22040-23720]]__
Some sort of travel stone.__
*105954*__
[[S:::34510-35200]]__
You know it?__
*105955*__
[[S:::46290-47300]]__
He held this.__
*105956*__
[[S:::48720-50350]]__
In the panel in Odin’s library.__
*105957*__
[[S:::70550-72871]]__
The Realm Between Realms…__
*105958*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s515_010_son_stem:9881-10411]]__
Dreifa.__
*105959*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s515_010_mmr_stem:19260-21120]]__
Well? What’ve we got?__
*105960*__
[[S:::24890-25730]]__
Let me see…__
*105961*__
[[S:::30230-31620]]__
Great Auðumbla’s udders—__
*105962*__
[[S:::32010-33570]]__
that’s the Unity Stone!__
*105963*__
[[S:::35800-37680]]__
I wasn’t sure it existed!__
*105964*__
[[S:::38280-39760]]__
If Týr possessed this,__
*105965*__
[[S:::40160-44250]]__
that explains how he could visit all the realms, and other lands, to boot.__
*105966*__
[[S:::50990-51660]]__
Yes…__
*105967*__
[[S:::53140-56320]]__
Yes! That’s it—I understand now.__
*105968*__
[[S:::56850-60120]]__
It shows Týr walking the Realm Between Realms.__
*105969*__
[[S:::60630-62680]]__
You know how you must never stray from the path?__
*105970*__
[[S:::63190-63690]]__
Well,__
*105971*__
[[S:::63970-67400]]__
Týr always followed his own path, if you catch my meaning.__
*105972*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s520_010_mmr_stem:17385-25220]]__
Thooooor stuh-tooooo… eeeee-kneeeee smooooo-thooooo thooooor-fah.__
*105973*__
[[S:::32896-33862]]__
Ohhhh.__
*105974*__
[[S:::38190-41114]]__
Uhh, he thinks it might still be in his stomach.__
*105975*__
[[S:::41447-46490]]__
Um… and he’s open to letting you row into his mouth to look inside.__
*105976*__
[[S:::51345-54750]]__
By the by, he’s not wild about it either.__
*105977*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s520_010_spt_stem:26190-32600]]__
Skeeeeel-yaaaaah. Pvooooo-meeeee-thooooor…__
*105978*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s520_010_kra_stem:36210-37690]]__
Is the statue lost to us?__
*105979*__
[[S:::57357-58902]]__
Mmmh…__
*105980*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s520_010_son_stem:48627-49570]]__
Ew,__
*105981*__
[[S:::50070-50864]]__
really?__
*105982*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl12_s010_001_son:160-1150]]__
There it is! We’ve got it!__
*105983*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl12_s010_002_mmr:100-2680]]__
Ha! I guess the Temple was made to be flipped.__
*105984*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl12_s010_010_son:130-1750]]__
Look, the tree’s upside down!__
*105985*__
[[S:::2240-3620]]__
Or… are we?__
*105986*__
[[S:::4100-5000]]__
I’m not sure anymore.__
*105987*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl12_s010_020_mmr:160-2630]]__
Rather looks… exactly as it did before.__
*105988*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl12_s020_010_son:107-3467]]__
So you’re saying Týr’s shrine was showing him stepping off the branch of the world tree.__
*105989*__
[[S:::4013-8449]]__
And you’re thinking, to reach the secret path to Jötunheim, that’s what we need to do?__
*105990*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl12_s020_020_kra:80-874]]__
I am.__
*105991*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl12_s020_030_mmr:100-1034]]__
Oh, dear.__
*105992*__
[[S:::1300-3050]]__
That is what you’re thinking, isn’t it?__
*105993*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl12_s030_010_son:0-500]]__
Good.__
*105994*__
[[S:::960-4710]]__
I am more than okay with not throwing ourselves over the edge of the World Tree just yet.__
*105995*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl12_s030_020_kra:50-1361]]__
In due time, boy.__
*105996*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl12_s030_030_mmr:50-550]]__
Uh…__
*105997*__
[[S:::867-1367]]__
really?__
*105998*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl12_s030_030_mmr_a:50-580]]__
Uh…__
*105999*__
[[S:::830-1474]]__
really?__
*106000*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s492_010_kra_stem:3440-5570]]__
You will LISTEN to me and not speak a word.__
*106001*__
[[S:::6230-9470]]__
I am your father—and you, boy, are not yourself.__
*106002*__
[[S:::10110-14550]]__
You are too quick to temper. You are rash, insubordinate, and out of control.__
*106003*__
[[S:::15320-16840]]__
This will not stand.__
*106004*__
[[S:::17790-21250]]__
You will honor your mother and abandon this path you have chosen.__
*106005*__
[[S:::23220-24220]]__
It is not too late…__
*106006*__
[[S:::27930-29580]]__
This discussion is far from over.__
*106007*__
[[S:::30600-32550]]__
We are here because of you, boy.__
*106008*__
[[S:::34360-35350]]__
Never forget that.__
*106009*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s494_010_pbld_stem:280-4740]]__
No…no, I would never have wanted this!__
*106010*__
[[S:::5970-7720]]__
You… you had no right.__
*106011*__
[[S:::10440-12220]]__
You had no RIGHT, Witch!!__
*106012*__
[[S:::13670-18530]]__
I can’t taste. I can’t smell. I can’t even feel the temperature of this… this room.__
*106013*__
[[S:::19570-24930]]__
Feasting… drinking… women. It’s all gone. Gone!__
*106014*__
[[S:::32080-38620]]__
Than never feel again? Yes. YES! I would rather die.__
*106015*__
[[S:::39710-45100]]__
Take it away, mother. Please… please, please, take it away.__
*106016*__
[[S:::46110-47240]]__
Oh please…(crying)__
*106017*__
[[S:::63710-64300]]__
No…__
*106018*__
[[S:::66670-67180]]__
I won’t.__
*106019*__
[[S:::72650-73920]]__
You ruined my life.__
*106020*__
[[S:::78030-78490]]__
NO!__
*106021*__
[[S:::83160-85670]]__
No, not if you can’t fix it, Mother.__
*106022*__
[[S:::89100-90030]]__
Come on.__
*106023*__
[[S:::94540-95540]]__
COME ON!__
*106024*__
[[S:::120400-122310]]__
I never want to see you again.__
*106025*__
[[S:::125820-126680]]__
Never.__
*106026*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s494_010_fre_stem:7740-10520]]__
I had every right. I am your mother.__
*106027*__
[[S:::23470-27010]]__
But you will never have to feel pain again.__
*106028*__
[[S:::27690-31950]]__
Death has no power over you now. You would rather die?__
*106029*__
[[S:::40860-41510]]__
… I can’t.__
*106030*__
[[S:::44960-48500]]__
It doesn’t work like that, Son.__
*106031*__
[[S:::49480-53030]]__
Trust me in time you will thank me.__
*106032*__
[[S:::55310-56660]]__
You will thank me.__
*106033*__
[[S:::74090-78050]]__
Honey, we can figure this out. I promise, trust me, I know how —__
*106034*__
[[S:::90850-91550]]__
Son—__
*106035*__
[[S:::95530-96050]]__
Son—__
*106036*__
[[S:::130030-131030]]__
(crying)__
*106037*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s494_010_bld_stem:38710-39360]]__
Yes.__
*106038*__
[[S:::56060-56510]]__
C’mon.__
*106039*__
[[S:::65430-66050]]__
Yes.__
*106040*__
[[S:::69000-69500]]__
C’mon,__
*106041*__
[[S:::71350-71790]]__
c’mon.__
*106042*__
[[S:::90540-91600]]__
Do it. DO IT!__
*106043*__
[[S:::92380-92830]]__
Do it.__
*106044*__
[[S:::110220-111180]]__
Coward!__
*106045*__
[[S:::142950-145040]]__
What you did to me…__
*106046*__
[[S:::146880-151250]]__
WHAT YOU DID TO ME!! (screams and yells)__
*106047*__
[[S:::164020-175690]]__
(crying) I’m a coward… I’m a… I’m a coward. I’m a worth.. worthless coward (continued crying)__
*106048*__
[[S:::196290-203580]]__
(crying) I’m a coward… I’m a, I’m a worth, worthless coward…(continued crying)__
*106049*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s495a_010_kra_stem:3120-3810]]__
Atreus.__
*106050*__
[[S:::7040-7750]]__
Together now.__
*106051*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s495a_010_son_stem:5600-6553]]__
I can help?__
*106053*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s495b_010_son_stem:7430-9626]]__
We did it. We’re free.__
*106054*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s499_010_son_stem:3244-6192]]__
Look at that! It’s the missing panel, about Týr.__
*106055*__
[[S:::8387-11243]]__
Odin must have stolen it. But why?__
*106056*__
[[S:::22205-24077]]__
Why? What does it mean?__
*106057*__
[[S:::41834-43383]]__
What are those runes in the corners?__
*106058*__
[[S:::50744-51712]]__
How do you…?__
*106059*__
[[S:::57523-58342]]__
Oh.__
*106060*__
[[S:::88322-89355]]__
What is that!?__
*106061*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s499_010_mmr_stem:11599-15443]]__
He always has his reasons. Might I have a look?__
*106062*__
[[S:::18662-21605]]__
Well… this is most unexpected.__
*106063*__
[[S:::24079-26726]]__
I haven’t the foggiest. Isn’t that unexpected?__
*106064*__
[[S:::27778-32918]]__
Look, clearly that’s Týr… travelling, somehow, perhaps magically.__
*106065*__
[[S:::33733-37792]]__
But what’s that to do with the Giants, that they should devote a shrine to it?__
*106066*__
[[S:::38344-41103]]__
I’m afraid that is none too clear.__
*106067*__
[[S:::44042-48306]]__
Not runes. Symbols… from different lands. They mean—__
*106068*__
[[S:::49557-50742]]__
Aye.__
*106069*__
[[S:::67776-71750]]__
No doubt signifying the gift of sight the Giants granted us…__
*106070*__
[[S:::71750-73571]]__
Give me a closer look.__
*106071*__
[[S:::76606-77893]]__
Interesting…__
*106072*__
[[S:::85159-87919]]__
Very interesting.__
*106073*__
[[S:::89574-96564]]__
Secret plans, concealed by Týr so none could access but him… and those few others the Giants trusted.__
*106074*__
[[S:::97081-102543]]__
And right under Odin’s nose—ha-ha! I did promise I’d get you to Jötunheim…__
*106075*__
[[S:::106497-110912]]__
Don’t you see, brother? Odin never gave up hope, and neither should we.__
*106076*__
[[S:::111232-114605]]__
He knew there was a clue in here, but we’re the ones who found it.__
*106077*__
[[S:::114605-118014]]__
These plans are for a key to some chamber Týr’s kept hidden.__
*106078*__
[[S:::118214-122194]]__
I don’t know where it’s leading us or what we’ll find… but it’s a path.__
*106079*__
[[S:::127192-129031]]__
I suggest we ask a Dwarf.__
*106080*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s499_010_kra_stem:26800-27778]]__
Head…__
*106081*__
[[S:::48700-49557]]__
War.__
*106082*__
[[S:::52600-54761]]__
This one I know too well.__
*106083*__
[[S:::62880-63770]]__
His eyes.__
*106084*__
[[S:::64450-65650]]__
They are jewels.__
*106085*__
[[S:::66540-67580]]__
Like yours.__
*106086*__
[[S:::102460-103884]]__
What do you mean, Head?__
*106087*__
[[S:::104240-106325]]__
You said we were out of options.__
*106088*__
[[S:::124770-126753]]__
How do we make this key?__
*106089*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s500_010_kra_stem:6260-7033]]__
Boy…__
*106090*__
[[S:::9040-9906]]__
Before…__
*106091*__
[[S:::10774-11847]]__
what you…__
*106092*__
[[S:::12700-13587]]__
saw…__
*106093*__
[[S:::18920-20695]]__
You did not see me with someone?__
*106094*__
[[S:::21550-22838]]__
An old man?__
*106095*__
[[S:::31710-32467]]__
Yes…__
*106096*__
[[S:::34350-35189]]__
very well.__
*106097*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s500_010_son_stem:15520-16814]]__
I didn’t see anything.__
*106098*__
[[S:::24070-25067]]__
What old man?__
*106099*__
[[S:::29400-30552]]__
Can we go?__
*106100*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s498_010_zeu_stem:12800-14370]]__
It is time, my son.__
*106101*__
[[S:::15310-17693]]__
Look around at what you have done.__
*106102*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s498_010_son_stem:57004-58586]]__
Come on. We gotta go.__
*106103*__
[[S:::60371-61950]]__
There’s no time! LOOK!__
*106104*__
[[S:::77088-78159]]__
I have a plan!__
*106105*__
[[S:::79807-80661]]__
JUMP!!__
*106106*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s498_010_kra_stem:58700-60065]]__
You saw...__
*106107*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s498_010_mmr_stem:100610-104074]]__
That was your plan? You’re both cracked!__
*106109*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s040_010_son_stem:0-1060]]__
It was me…__
*106110*__
[[S:::21476-23516]]__
That wasn’t me.__
*106111*__
[[S:::24548-25604]]__
I couldn’t have done that.__
*106112*__
[[S:::29659-30126]]__
Yeah.__
*106113*__
[[S:::33443-33959]]__
Yeah.__
*106114*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s040_010_pson_stem:3300-4440]]__
But we’re gods.__
*106115*__
[[S:::5950-9470]]__
We can do whatever we want.__
*106116*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s040_010_kra_stem:9470-10490]]__
Turn away, boy.__
*106117*__
[[S:::25740-27230]]__
Do not dwell on those thoughts.__
*106118*__
[[S:::27830-28530]]__
Not here.__
*106119*__
[[S:::30970-31950]]__
We must keep moving.__
*106120*__
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s040_010_pmdi_stem:10490-12691]]__
Hehehehe…__
*106121*__
[[S:::13988-15807]]__
that’s what I said… to your mother…__
*106122*__
[[S:::16520-18160]]__
right before I gave it to her.__
*106123*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s010_010_kra:0-600]]__
BOY?__
*106124*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s010_020_son:0-810]]__
I’m here…__
*106125*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s010_030_kra:10-949]]__
Stay still.__
*106126*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s010_040_son:80-1200]]__
Are you gonna help me?!__
*106127*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s010_060_son:59-1189]]__
Hellooooo!__
*106128*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s010_050_son:122-1829]]__
Nngh. I’m stuck! C’mon!__
*106129*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s020_020_mmr:0-1060]]__
Not just Hel…__
*106130*__
[[S:::1420-3217]]__
worst place in Hel you could’ve put us.__
*106131*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s020_010_son:34-2674]]__
Wow, it’s cold. This is Hel?__
*106132*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s020_011_son:3-1424]]__
I can’t believe we’re back in Hel.__
*106133*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s020_030_kra:0-750]]__
I see a ship.__
*106134*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s020_040_mmr:0-630]]__
Get us there.__
*106135*__
[[S:::1120-3220]]__
It only takes us halfway to Týr’s Temple__
*106136*__
[[S:::3610-5500]]__
but at least it gets us far from here.__
*106137*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s020_050_mmr:20-3600]]__
For a thousand mortal lifetimes, the Bridge Keeper kept the living out of this place.__
*106138*__
[[S:::4120-6230]]__
But now that you’ve ripped his heart out, here we are.__
*106139*__
[[S:::6810-8250]]__
Funny how it all comes around.__
*106140*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s030_010_son:9-545]]__
Warm.__
*106141*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s030_020_mmr:14-2271]]__
Isn’t that the substance that catches fire?__
*106142*__
[[S:PHANTOM SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s040_010_pson:40-1750]]__
He should pay for what he said about mother.__
*106143*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s040_020_kra:21-673]]__
Boy?__
*106144*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s040_030_son:0-2265]]__
That… wasn’t me.__
*106145*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s050_010_kra:0-500]]__
Head.__
*106146*__
[[S:::830-1500]]__
What was that?__
*106147*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s050_020_mmr:0-3690]]__
Not just the old and sick come to Helheim… so do the criminals.__
*106148*__
[[S:::4330-8250]]__
Hel must not draw a distinction between us and those whom these visions are meant to torture.__
*106149*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s050_030_kra:0-870]]__
How do we stop it?__
*106150*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s050_040_mmr:0-1030]]__
Escape Hel.__
*106151*__
[[S:::1430-2500]]__
As soon as possible.__
*106152*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s050_050_son:40-5854]]__
I’m not gonna let it bother me. Like you said, Mimir—it was just an illusion. That wasn’t me.__
*106153*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s050_060_kra:0-662]]__
No.__
*106154*__
[[S:::1410-3330]]__
But it is who you have become of late.__
*106155*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s050_070_son:70-570]]__
Look,__
*106156*__
[[S:::930-2290]]__
I know I got us into this.__
*106157*__
[[S:::2710-3560]]__
But I’ll get us out__
*106158*__
[[S:::4255-5077]]__
...whoever I am.__
*106159*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s050_080_kra:40-2750]]__
I will get us out. You will follow orders.__
*106160*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s050_090_son:61-1477]]__
But maybe that’s not who I am.__
*106161*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s050_100_kra:36-3309]]__
It had better be. Now let me focus.__
*106162*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s060_010_mmr:0-2144]]__
I don’t mean to hurry you, but… faster?__
*106163*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s060_020_kra:1-820]]__
Let me think.__
*106164*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s060_030_son:0-660]]__
So…__
*106165*__
[[S:::1170-2750]]__
I can’t feel my fingers.__
*106166*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s060_031_mmr:0-1750]]__
Maybe both wind traps need to be filled?__
*106167*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s060_040_mmr:0-2500]]__
Those gears up there… could we jam a door open maybe?__
*106168*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s060_050_kra:4-693]]__
Keep moving.__
*106169*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s070_010_son:0-640]]__
Wait,__
*106170*__
[[S:::840-1980]]__
I think I see Baldur up ahead…__
*106171*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s080_010_kra:12-940]]__
Stay out of sight.__
*106172*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s080_020_son:1-412]]__
Listen…__
*106173*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s090_010_kra:210-1690]]__
Freya is his mother…__
*106174*__
[[S:::2550-3710]]__
and she kept this from us.__
*106175*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s090_020_son:0-2500]]__
But did we ever even tell Freya that he was hunting us?__
*106176*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s090_030_mmr:0-3971]]__
They haven’t spoken in years; I can’t imagine those two are conspiring.__
*106177*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s090_040_kra:0-690]]__
It can wait.__
*106178*__
[[S:::1300-2000]]__
There is the ship.__
*106179*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s095_010_kra:0-1450]]__
Freya is his mother.__
*106180*__
[[S:::1840-4000]]__
How did that escape your stories, Head?__
*106181*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s095_020_kra:0-1350]]__
Freya is his mother.__
*106182*__
[[S:::1950-3500]]__
Why did you keep this from us, Head?__
*106183*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s095_030_mmr:20-1500]]__
Would you believe it slipped m’mind?__
*106184*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s095_040_kra:50-750]]__
I would not.__
*106185*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s095_050_mmr:260-1451]]__
I’m at a loss.__
*106186*__
[[S:::1850-4360]]__
I assure you I’ve no reason to keep such a thing a secret.__
*106187*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s095_060_kra:70-960]]__
There’s the boat.__
*106188*__
[[S:::1550-3070]]__
We will speak more of this.__
*106189*__
[[S:::3590-4500]]__
Soon.__
*106190*__
[[S:PHANTOM OLD MAN:vo_lvl_hel02_s100_010_zeu:0-1660]]__
Such chaos.__
*106191*__
[[S:::2150-5000]]__
I will have much to do after I kill you.__
*106192*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s100_020_son:19-698]]__
Who was that?__
*106193*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s100_030_kra:0-670]]__
We must hurry.__
*106194*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_010_mmr:0-470]]__
Er…__
*106195*__
[[S:::1020-3230]]__
not entirely sure this is seaworthy.__
*106196*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_020_kra:0-500]]__
She will do.__
*106197*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_021_kra:0-3200]]__
In that case, we need to sail this boat as far away from here as possible.__
*106198*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_030_son:100-2250]]__
Can this thing even sail covered in all this bramble?__
*106199*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_031_son:0-440]]__
Mimir?__
*106200*__
[[S:::920-2140]]__
How’s the fire staying lit?__
*106201*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_032_mmr:31-1632]]__
Would you believe “magic”?__
*106202*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_033_son:0-900]]__
Or those blades…__
*106203*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_050_son:0-500]]__
Now what?__
*106204*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_060_kra:0-1250]]__
Give me space to work.__
*106205*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_080_son:30-620]]__
Locked, huh?__
*106206*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_100_son:70-790]]__
Let me help.__
*106207*__
[[S:::1510-2130]]__
What can I do?__
*106208*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_110_kra:70-1000]]__
You have done enough.__
*106209*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_120_son:59-1184]]__
The sails are intact!__
*106210*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_130_son:187-800]]__
We’re moving!__
*106211*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_170_mmr:0-3620]]__
Great. Just bear in mind—this boat can only take us part of the way.__
*106212*__
[[S:::4140-9380]]__
Týr’s Temple is near the top of a tremendous waterfall which, sadly, we are downstream.__
*106213*__
[[S:::9780-11530]]__
That means even if we get there intact,__
*106214*__
[[S:::11950-14744]]__
we’d still need to sail UP a waterfall somehow.__
*106215*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_180_son:150-3500]]__
The Vanir built the greatest ship that ever was and it can fly.__
*106216*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_190_mmr:0-970]]__
Skíðblaðnir?__
*106217*__
[[S:::1340-1840]]__
Yeh…__
*106218*__
[[S:::2120-5500]]__
because it was designed to fly. This was not.__
*106219*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_200_kra:0-2370]]__
Nevertheless, this is the boat we have.__
*106220*__
[[S:::2960-3500]]__
We make due.__
*106221*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_040_kra:4-366]]__
There.__
*106222*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_090_kra:0-870]]__
We raise sail.__
*106223*__
[[S:::1300-2500]]__
There should be a crank aft.__
*106224*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_120_kra:19-411]]__
Here.__
*106225*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_130_kra:0-520]]__
Locked.__
*106226*__
[[S:::1130-2350]]__
We must free the rigging.__
*106227*__
[[S:::2970-3750]]__
To the other side.__
*106228*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_140_kra:0-1750]]__
That latch joins the rigging to the deck.__
*106229*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_150_son:0-480]]__
Oh…__
*106230*__
[[S:::1020-1527]]__
I see.__
*106231*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_160_kra:0-1000]]__
The sails are intact.__
*106232*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_020_son:40-1370]]__
Owp! We’re stuck.__
*106233*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_030_mmr:0-2250]]__
On perhaps the biggest iceberg I’ve ever seen.__
*106234*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_030_mmr_a:0-2490]]__
On perhaps the biggest iceberg I’ve ever seen.__
*106235*__
[[S:::3080-4250]]__
We are now officially sunk.__
*106236*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_031_son:8-1542]]__
The whole front of the boat’s blocked!__
*106237*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_032_kra:0-1250]]__
The bow of the boat.__
*106238*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_040_son:80-1410]]__
At least the fire’s making heat.__
*106239*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_050_son:30-550]]__
What now?__
*106240*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_060_son:60-1572]]__
I’m trying not to be impatient…__
*106241*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_070_mmr:51-1212]]__
Let your father think.__
*106242*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_080_son:30-789]]__
You’re chopping it…?__
*106243*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_090_mmr:0-1250]]__
Give your father room.__
*106244*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_100_son:90-1500]]__
So now the sails are loose…?__
*106245*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_101_kra:0-750]]__
Just watch.__
*106246*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_110_son:0-1280]]__
You cut the sails loose.__
*106247*__
[[S:::2010-2640]]__
So now what?__
*106248*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_200_son:110-1080]]__
You’re pulling the sails down?__
*106249*__
[[S:::2090-3350]]__
But how they gonna catch the wind?__
*106250*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_010_son:4-1262]]__
It worked, we’re moving!__
*106251*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_050_kra:0-1500]]__
Good, back to the latch.__
*106252*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_080_mmr:6-3201]]__
I’m fairly certain you’re damaging our only mode of transport.__
*106253*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_090_kra:0-424]]__
There.__
*106254*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_100_mmr:0-920]]__
That’s helpful.__
*106255*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_110_kra:0-1790]]__
You are a very negative head.__
*106256*__
[[S:::2520-3480]]__
Now back to the crank.__
*106257*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_120_son:10-1702]]__
You wanted to show us something back at the crank?__
*106258*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_130_mmr:0-1250]]__
You’re encouraging him…__
*106259*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_140_son:0-2943]]__
You’re pulling the sails down? But how are they going to catch the wind?__
*106260*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s130_010_son:19-3633]]__
We’re floating! The heat from the fires! We’re actually floating!__
*106261*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s130_020_son:13-1285]]__
Aaaaand we’re stuck again.__
*106262*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s130_030_kra:0-2000]]__
Not for long. Stay with the boat.__
*106263*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s130_040_son:3-2636]]__
I can’t believe it. You just made a huge sky lantern.__
*106264*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s130_050_son:30-1600]]__
Our ship’s lodged on this bridge.__
*106265*__
[[S:::2240-2949]]__
Sure I can’t help?__
*106266*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s130_060_kra:40-1460]]__
I said stay on the boat.__
*106267*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s130_070_son:0-1000]]__
Staying on the boat…__
*106268*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s130_080_son:51-1624]]__
The ship’s stuck on this bridge over here!__
*106269*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s130_080_son_a:55-1608]]__
The ship’s stuck on this bridge over here!__
*106270*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s130_090_son:71-1721]]__
That did it. We’re loose!__
*106271*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s130_100_kra:50-1000]]__
Wait for me there!__
*106272*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s135_010_son:50-2371]]__
Look! Now we’re stuck on this bridge!__
*106273*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s132_010_mmr:0-1277]]__
We need to talk, brother.__
*106274*__
[[S:::1910-4060]]__
You do realize it’s over, don’t you?__
*106275*__

he might become everyone’s concern if you don’t do something.__

NOW.__

What is this place?__
*106358*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s220_020_mmr:70-4000]]__
This is Odin’s. I’d recognize his atrocious taste anywhere.__

Look at all this…__

[[S:::1810-4750]]__
The amount of arcane knowledge hidden between these walls—__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s220_031_son:38-2240]]__
It’s so much bigger than his other libraries!__
*106362*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s220_040_kra:0-2500]]__
I would rather not be here when Odin returns. Come.__
*106363*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s215_010_son:0-2960]]__
I think this is where Odin brought all his best clues about Jötunheim!__
*106364*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s230_010_son:40-2230]]__
I think I know just the door that key goes to.__

[[S:::3260-4160]]__
Down by the water,__

*106367*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s230_020_son:40-1350]]__
That symbol on the temple door…__
*106368*__
[[S:::2020-3240]]__
it’s a bunch of runes together.__
*106369*__
[[S:::4140-4640]]__
Peace.__

*106372*__
[[S:::7420-8200]]__
other things too.__
*106373*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s230_030_mmr:40-2960]]__
Týr’s own design. He made this door himself.__
*106374*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s230_040_son:26-1332]]__
That’s your answer to everything.__
*106375*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s240_010_mmr:60-3080]]__
Alright, let’s get back to Midgard and see about making that key.__
*106376*__
[[S:::3700-4500]]__
Where’s that Dwarf?__
*106377*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_010_kra:80-1010]]__
Now, Head—__
*106378*__
[[S:::1540-4000]]__
why did you not tell us Baldur is the son of Freya?__
*106379*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_010_kra_a:0-850]]__
Now, Head—__
*106380*__
[[S:::1210-3750]]__
why did you not tell us Baldur is the son of Freya?__
*106381*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_010_kra_b:0-850]]__
Now, Head—__
*106382*__
[[S:::1210-3750]]__
why did you not tell us Baldur is the son of Freya?__
*106383*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_020_mmr:110-1344]]__
He IS!__
*106384*__
[[S:::1690-5305]]__
It’s shocking every time I hear it and yet obviously I know it.__
*106385*__
[[S:::5684-8990]]__
But when I think about Baldur and Freya, I…__
*106386*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_030_son:35-635]]__
Mimir?__
*106387*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_040_mmr:100-742]]__
Yes, lad?__
*106388*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_050_kra:1574-2300]]__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_050_kra_a:68-864]]__
(chuckle) Freya.__
*106390*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_060_mmr:66-973]]__
How’s that, brother?__
*106391*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_070_kra:70-769]]__
Head,__
*106392*__
[[S:::1350-3000]]__
tell me Baldur’s vulnerability.__
*106393*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_080_mmr:90-4250]]__
Baldur is blessed with invulnerability to all threats, physical or magical.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_090_son:0-1250]]__
Wait, what is happening?__

[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_110_mmr:97-5854]]__
I am? I AM! That’s it precisely. Ooh… I wonder how long that’s been so—__
*106397*__
[[S:::6075-10703]]__
since she had m’head at her mercy, or back when I figured out Baldur’s weakness.__
*106398*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_120_son:61-867]]__
Mimir!__
*106399*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_130_mmr:47-766]]__
Yes, lad?__
*106400*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_140_son:50-1828]]__
You just said you figured out Baldur’s weakness!__
*106401*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_150_mmr:140-848]]__
Did I?__
*106402*__
[[S:::1243-5507]]__
But Baldur is blessed with invulnerability to all threats, physical or magical.__
*106403*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_160_son:20-793]]__
AUGH!__
*106404*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_170_kra:100-775]]__
Enough.__
*106405*__
[[S:::1420-2860]]__
This means there is a way.__

[[S:::3460-4770]]__

[[S:::5460-6750]]__
we will find it.__

[[S::vo_lvl_cl13_s060_010_son_stem:74-4283]]__
Hey, guys. Question for you—anyone know where we can find Mimir’s other eye?__
*106410*__
[[S:::54128-55377]]__
What was the statue?__
*106411*__
[[S:::66276-68444]]__
How are we supposed to look inside the snake?__
*106412*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl13_s060_010_sin_stem:5110-5823]]__
Oh.__

[[S:::9627-10231]]__
That’s…__

[[S:::11685-12712]]__
I’m sorry.__
*106415*__
[[S:::13310-16045]]__
As a matter of fact, Odin asked me to…__
*106416*__
[[S:::18560-20276]]__
he wanted me to build a…__
*106417*__
[[S:::22800-24988]]__

declined.__
*106419*__
[[S:::28880-29210]]__
Sorry,__

[[S:::29680-30960]]__
will you excuse me?__

[[S:::63140-64100]]__
Sorry about that.__
*106422*__
[[S:::64545-65395]]__

*106423*__
[[S:::69804-72138]]__

*106424*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl13_s060_010_mmr_stem:31570-32910]]__
Well, that was useless.__
*106425*__
[[S:::77600-80759]]__
We’d better go see what the World Serpent has to say about that.__
*106426*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl13_s060_010_brk_stem:33910-34760]]__
You know…__
*106427*__
[[S:::35256-42525]]__
it was about that same time that Odin came around lookin’ for me to build a statue with some sort of hidden compartment.__
*106428*__
[[S:::43246-50619]]__
Now, that not being a weapon and the Aesir being a bunch of pock-speckled cockers, I too saw fit to decline.__

[[S:::50920-53615]]__
But I know he got it built just the same.__
*106430*__
[[S:::56484-60316]]__
Eh, it’s that one of Thor out there flashin’ his sac to the lake.__
*106431*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl13_s060_010_kra_stem:60870-62500]]__
The statue that the serpent ate.__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s010_010_son:144-676]]__
Look,__
*106433*__
[[S:::1020-1948]]__
we’re back in Midgard!__
*106434*__
[[S:::2610-3359]]__
There’s the bridge!__
*106435*__
[[S:::3939-4504]]__
We did it—__
*106436*__
[[S:::4813-6107]]__
the tower’s back where it belongs!__
*106437*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s010_020_mmr:120-2054]]__
Just when I thought I’d seen it all.__
*106438*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s010_020_mmr_a:191-2134]]__
Just when I thought I’d seen it all.__
*106439*__
[[S:::2730-5833]]__
Now to the Realm Travel Room and then to Jötunheim.__
*106440*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl13_s010_030_kra:160-2857]]__
Now Týr’s Travel Room can take us to Jötunheim.__
*106441*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s010_040_son:7-553]]__
And look—__
*106442*__
[[S:::921-3621]]__
now we can finally light all the braziers and see what happens!__
*106443*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s010_050_son:115-1247]]__
How did Týr do this?__
*106444*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s010_060_mmr:0-5049]]__
Odin suspected the Giants secretly possessed some remnant of primordial Jötnar creative essence—__
*106445*__
[[S:::5123-6900]]__
the stuff all realms were made of.__
*106446*__
[[S:::7360-10322]]__
The Unity stone must have been fashioned from that essence.__
*106447*__
[[S:::10731-13103]]__
To trust an outsider with it, even Týr,__
*106448*__
[[S:::13347-15194]]__
tells you just how desperate they were.__
*106449*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s020_010_mmr:140-1468]]__
You take a wrong turn, brother?__
*106450*__
[[S:::1762-3500]]__
Realm Travel Room’s back up top.__
*106451*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s020_020_son:140-3132]]__
We might have last minute stuff we wanna do before we leave.__
*106452*__
[[S:::3481-4973]]__
Who knows how long we’ll be gone.__
*106453*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s020_030_mmr:172-797]]__
Fair enough!__
*106454*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s030_010_mmr:154-3665]]__
I don’t know what we’ll find when we get to Jötunheim, but we must cover our tracks.__
*106455*__
[[S:::3966-6744]]__
Odin’s ravens will tell him of the tower’s restoration,__
*106456*__
[[S:::7013-9750]]__
and we mustn’t let our efforts be to his benefit.__
*106457*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl13_s030_020_kra:50-819]]__
Very well.__
*106458*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_010_son:77-1581]]__
This is it. Here we go!__
*106459*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_020_mmr:200-2839]]__
Hold on, wait a minute… this isn’t going to work.__
*106460*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_030_kra:45-436]]__
What?__
*106461*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_040_mmr:150-1590]]__
There’s no travel crystal.__
*106462*__
[[S:::2150-6500]]__
Týr must have used his own eyes to refract the energy. It was his final failsafe.__
*106463*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_050_son:62-1571]]__
But you’ve got eyes like him, Mimir.__
*106464*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_060_mmr:170-2530]]__
I’ve got AN eye—one!__
*106465*__
[[S:::2960-6500]]__
Odin plucked out my other eye precisely to keep me from travelling.__
*106466*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_070_mmr:180-1090]]__
Sorry, lads.__
*106467*__
[[S:::1590-2500]]__
Thought that would work…__
*106468*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_080_kra:0-1750]]__
What did Odin do with your other eye?__
*106469*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_090_mmr:130-970]]__
He’d have kept it…__
*106470*__
[[S:::1430-3060]]__
in any of a hundred places, I’m afraid.__
*106471*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_100_son:60-2832]]__
We’ve come so far. There has to be a way.__
*106472*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_110_mmr:90-490]]__
Look…__
*106473*__
[[S:::840-1760]]__
bit of a long shot,__
*106474*__
[[S:::2029-4858]]__
but for years I’d see Sindri, sometimes Brok,__
*106475*__
[[S:::5075-8088]]__
lurking around on that mountain when Odin came for his visits.__
*106476*__
[[S:::8470-10000]]__
Maybe they know something?__
*106477*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_120_son:19-878]]__
Brok and Sindri!__
*106478*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s050_010_son:0-3100]]__
We gotta remember to ask Sindri and Brok about your eye next time we see them.__
*106479*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s050_020_mmr:130-1760]]__
If they even know anything about it…__
*106480*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s060_010_son:74-3979]]__
Hey, guys. Question for you—anyone know where we can find Mimir’s other eye?__
*106481*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_cl13_s060_020_sin:0-270]]__
Oh.__
*106482*__
[[S:::880-1160]]__
Ohhh….__
*106483*__
[[S:::2330-4180]]__
No, no, no. That’__
*106484*__
[[S:::4570-5070]]__
s… I’__
*106485*__
[[S:::6290-6560]]__
m__
*106486*__
[[S:::6990-7580]]__
sorry. As__
*106487*__
[[S:::9480-9710]]__
a__
*106488*__
[[S:::12120-12360]]__
matter__
*106489*__
[[S:::14290-14500]]__
of fact, Odin asked me to… he wanted me to build a… he showed it to me, you see, and I… declined. If you’ll pardon me…__
*106490*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s060_030_mmr:160-1500]]__
Well, that was useless.__
*106491*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl13_s060_040_brk:210-6600]]__
You know… it was about that same time that Odin came around lookin’ for me to build a statue with__
*106492*__
[[S:::6600-8890]]__
some sort hidden compartment.__
*106493*__
[[S:::9350-16090]]__
Now that not being a weapon and the Aesir being a bunch of pock-speckled cockers. I too saw fit to__
*106494*__
[[S:::16090-16790]]__
decline.__
*106495*__
[[S:::17170-19400]]__
But I know he got it built just the same.__
*106496*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s060_050_son:30-959]]__
What was the statue?__
*106497*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl13_s060_060_brk:330-3750]]__
It’s that one of Thor, out there flashin’ his sac to the lake.__
*106498*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl13_s060_070_kra:43-1718]]__
The statue that the serpent ate.__
*106499*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_cl13_s060_080_sin:0-1049]]__
Sorry about that.__
*106500*__
[[S:::1680-2500]]__
Feeling much better.__
*106501*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s060_090_son:30-2250]]__
How are we supposed to look inside the snake?__
*106502*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_cl13_s060_100_sin:0-180]]__
OH,__
*106503*__
[[S:::790-1090]]__
no…__
*106504*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s060_110_mmr:123-3088]]__
We’d better go see what Jörmungandr has to say about that.__
*106505*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s060_110_mmr_a:110-2998]]__
We’d better go see what the World Serpent has to say about that.__
*106506*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s065_010_mmr:18-2049]]__
Well, lads, I don’t know what lies ahead,__
*106507*__
[[S:::2372-6079]]__
but now would be a good time to make sure your gear is ready for the worst.__
*106508*__
[[S:::6542-8845]]__
Anything you need to do, I’d do it now.__
*106509*__
[[S:::9351-10563]]__
Just some sage advice…__
*106510*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s070_010_mmr:0-1250]]__
Once more to the horn…__
*106511*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s080_010_mmr:22-3064]]__
(practicing vocal warm-ups)__
*106512*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s080_020_mmr:0-450]]__
Ready!__
*106513*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s090_010_son:120-1850]]__
So… are we really doing this?__
*106514*__
[[S:::2410-4430]]__
Letting the serpent… swallow us?__
*106515*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl13_s090_020_kra:40-1000]]__
You do not have to come.__
*106516*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s090_030_son:56-1736]]__
Well, I’m not gonna MISS this…__
*106517*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s100_010_son:150-4000]]__
I absolutely support this decision to put off getting eaten by the World Serpent.__
*106518*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s100_020_son:100-3000]]__
I am more than okay rowing away from the giant snake’s mouth…__
*106519*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s110_010_son:70-1750]]__
You… sure this is a good idea?__
*106520*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl13_s110_020_kra:50-588]]__
No.__
*106521*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s120_010_mmr:0-3640]]__
Well, brothers… I’ve been to many strange places… but this will be a new one.__
*106522*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s120_020_son:120-4710]]__
Heh… yeah, I’ve never been in a Giant’s belly either. How about you, father?__
*106523*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl13_s120_030_kra:250-2270]]__
Never one that was not trying to eat me.__
*106524*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s120_040_mmr:0-2500]]__
We really should expect that sort of response at this point.__
*106525*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s120_050_son:21-815]]__
Here we go…__
*106526*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s010_010_son:33-2847]]__
We’re inside! But… what is this place?__
*106527*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s010_020_mmr:30-2000]]__
Your guess is as good as mine, little brother.__
*106528*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s010_030_son:60-750]]__
Should I shoot it?__
*106529*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s020_010_son:50-5511]]__
The tree! We’re underneath the Realm Travel Room! But… why is the floor on the ceiling?__
*106530*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s020_020_mmr:60-2500]]__
Those realm doors seem to mirror the ones above…__
*106531*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s020_030_kra:110-600]]__
Keep looking.__
*106532*__
[[S:::1210-2000]]__
There must be more.__
*106533*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s040_010_kra:110-640]]__
Up there.__
*106534*__
[[S:::1370-3750]]__
Týr used the same magic to protect the Black Rune.__
*106535*__
[[S:::4430-6050]]__
The clue we seek may be inside.__
*106536*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s040_020_son:77-2254]]__
Hunh—right next to the Jötunheim door!__
*106537*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s040_030_mmr:30-1000]]__
Interesting…__
*106538*__
[[S:::1440-2360]]__
but can we reach it?__
*106539*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s040_040_kra:30-750]]__
Not from here.__
*106540*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s050_010_mmr:50-550]]__
Well!__
*106541*__
[[S:::950-2700]]__
One inner sanctum within another…__
*106542*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s050_020_son:20-990]]__
Those tapestries…__
*106543*__
[[S:::2070-3230]]__
looks like more Giant art…__
*106544*__
[[S:::4720-6500]]__
Whatever Týr did for them must have been big.__
*106545*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s060_010_son:0-1470]]__
Whoa. Who are they?__
*106546*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s065a_010_son:51-1884]]__
And look—another sand bowl.__
*106547*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s065b_010_son:40-500]]__
Ready?__
*106548*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s065c_010_kra:40-1250]]__

Hm… Ominous.__
*106551*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s065d_010_kra:40-1750]]__
Boy—on the statues.__
*106552*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s065d_020_son:20-590]]__
I see them…__
*106553*__
[[S:::1170-2000]]__
it says “Void.”__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s065e_010_kra:40-1750]]__

I was going to say “void”…__

this is the rune for Jötunheim?__

Everything!__

[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_100_mmr:0-4249]]__
Look at that… the whole Realm Travel Room is built on some kind of axle.__
*106582*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_110_son:98-1075]]__
There’s chains!__

There’s chains on both sides. Without those...__

*106596*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_190_mmr:0-3005]]__
No progress on the chains front as yet, seemingly.__
*106597*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s080_010_son:0-1590]]__
Oh! Did you know that would spin?__
*106598*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s080_020_son:90-1350]]__
I think I could hit that crystal…__
*106599*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s080_030_son:53-4913]]__
Look! The light’s making symbols on the floor. But… something’s not right.__
*106600*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s080_040_son:89-2071]]__
Something’s shifting. Keep it going….__
*106601*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s080_050_son:60-800]]__
Ah!__
*106602*__
[[S:::930-2160]]__
It’s the nine realms!__
*106603*__
[[S:::2640-4000]]__
Always about Unity with Týr.__
*106604*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s080_060_son:20-1023]]__
Hey, what’d you find?__
*106605*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s080_070_son:0-1500]]__
I… think it’s done all it’s gonna do.__
*106606*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s100_010_kra:0-2000]]__
How does it help us, to flip the temple?__
*106607*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s100_020_son:20-760]]__
At this point…__
*106608*__
[[S:::1180-1900]]__
how does it hurt?__
*106609*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s100_030_kra:20-1108]]__
Boy…__
*106610*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s100_040_son:0-410]]__
Look…__
*106611*__
[[S:::990-2340]]__
I just want to see the temple flip.__
*106612*__
[[S:::2920-5700]]__
Don’t you? C’mon… have a little faith.__
*106613*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s100_050_mmr:80-4250]]__
Are you quite sure flipping the temple is the only way to reach the whatever-it-is?__
*106614*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s100_060_kra:0-1340]]__
You said there would be a path.__
*106615*__
[[S:::1800-3000]]__
The temple can be flipped.__
*106616*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s100_070_mmr:80-3750]]__
Therefore… we flip the temple. The logic is unassailable…__
*106617*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s105_010_mmr:40-5982]]__
Hm… not sure what happens when we recklessly upend a room that’s rooted to eight other realms.__
*106618*__
[[S:::5982-10200]]__
I’m curious, of course… but it’s a leap to imagine it gets us to Jötunheim.__
*106619*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s105_020_son:36-984]]__
I don’t mind a leap.__
*106620*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s105_030_mmr:70-3500]]__
Well… who knows—perhaps you and Týr are the same kind of mad.__
*106621*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s105_040_son:98-1343]]__
Hey, look at that!__
*106622*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s105_050_son:40-980]]__
It’s like an army…__
*106623*__
[[S:::1390-2000]]__
of statues?__
*106624*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s105_060_mmr:70-2780]]__
Týr did say that in the world of peace he envisioned,__
*106625*__
[[S:::3150-5250]]__
the only soldiers he’d need would be statues.__
*106626*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s105_070_kra:70-3000]]__
There… where the chains meet. We must find a way around.__
*106627*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s105_080_kra:30-2915]]__
An army… of statues?__
*106628*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s105_080_kra_a:50-700]]__
An army…__
*106629*__
[[S:::1360-2500]]__
of statues?__
*106630*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s105_090_mmr:20-4498]]__
I don’t think they’re the kind that come to life, if that’s what you’re worried about.__
*106631*__
[[S:::3337-8445]]__
Týr often said in the world of peace he envisioned, the only soldiers he’d need would be statues.__
*106632*__
[[S:::8896-12116]]__
Bless his heart, but the bugger did take himself rather seriously, didn’t he?__
*106633*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s110_010_mmr:32-1854]]__
Again with the death traps!__
*106634*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s110_020_son:50-1100]]__
See you on the other side.__
*106635*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s110_030_mmr:27-3721]]__
I had a thought, brother… why don’t you let the lad carry me for a while?__
*106636*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s110_040_kra:70-1410]]__
And let you miss this?__
*106637*__
[[S:::2130-2630]]__
No.__
*106638*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s110_050_mmr:60-1970]]__
You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?__
*106639*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s110_060_kra:22-471]]__
Hmm.__
*106640*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s140_010_son:85-1450]]__
The chain! We made it!__
*106641*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s140_020_mmr:50-1850]]__
Time to do what you do, brother.__
*106642*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s143_010_son:110-2000]]__
“Until gods grow good”__
*106643*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cltf_s143_020_mmr:20-1250]]__
Could be quite a wait.__
*106644*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s143_030_son:60-560]]__
Nah—__
*106645*__
[[S:::1390-2500]]__
they’re just waiting for us.__
*106646*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s146_010_son:160-1750]]__
“Leave them in Peace”__
*106647*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cltf_s146_020_mmr:30-2000]]__
Obviously not referring to us…__
*106648*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s150_009_son:33-503]]__
Look out!__
*106649*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s150_010_kra:100-2000]]__
Come. The other chain waits.__
*106650*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s170_010_kra:740-1300]]__
RAAAAAA!__
*106651*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s170_020_mmr:0-2406]]__
Going to have to break both chains, I’m afraid.__
*106652*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s170_030_kra:26-1191]]__
Obviously.__
*106653*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s170_040_kra:43-3093]]__
RAAAAAA!__
*106654*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cltf_s170_050_mmr:69-3049]]__
I’m fairly sure it’s on the side you didn’t go before.__
*106655*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s170_060_kra:0-650]]__
Head…__
*106656*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s170_070_kra:2180-2450]]__
RAAAAAA!__
*106657*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cltf_s170_080_mmr:30-1500]]__
I’m biting my tongue.__
*106658*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s180_010_mmr:20-3671]]__
Ah, it’s the other kind. Variety is so important.__
*106659*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s180_020_son:0-1730]]__
Gettin’ pretty good at crawling into holes,__
*106660*__
[[S:::2190-2750]]__
anyway…__
*106661*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s180_030_mmr:70-1750]]__
I truly do hate this part…__
*106662*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s180_040_kra:20-974]]__
I know.__
*106663*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s200_010_son:56-2035]]__
I can’t believe we’re so close!__
*106664*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s200_020_mmr:20-1220]]__
I, for one, never doubted.__
*106665*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s200_030_son:0-400]]__
Right.__
*106666*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s210_010_kra:110-800]]__
Boy?__
*106667*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s210_020_son:0-550]]__
Yes sir?__
*106668*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s210_030_kra:0-1250]]__
Time to flip the temple.__
*106669*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s210_040_son:30-610]]__
Yes SIR!__
*106670*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s210_050_mmr:0-2650]]__
Let’s just agree to stop saying “flip the temple”—__
*106671*__
[[S:::3000-4500]]__
it’s starting to sound normal.__
*106672*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s220_010_mmr:44-7102]]__
Brothers… I know what I promised, but in case this doesn’t work, just remember—Týr had good cause to create these obstacles.__
*106673*__
[[S:::7310-11496]]__
He’s kept Jötunheim out of Odin’s reach, but the world is hardly at peace.__
*106674*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s220_020_son:49-4533]]__
No… but it’s got hope. We’re all working together now… we have unity.__
*106675*__
[[S:::4910-8676]]__
That’s what the rune on the  door to this place was telling us. We’re on Týr’s path.__
*106676*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s230_010_mmr:30-1450]]__
Lift with your legs, brother.__
*106677*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s230_020_son:0-900]]__
He knows.__
*106678*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s230_020_son_a:40-900]]__
He knows.__
*106679*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s230_030_mmr:70-1250]]__
Just trying to be helpful.__
*106680*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s230_040_kra:1310-4078]]__
RAAAAAA!__
*106681*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s230_050_mmr:40-1480]]__
Bloody outstanding!__
*106682*__
[[S:::2010-6110]]__
On the day that brute force is the answer, I’ll be quite happy to be on your side, brother.__
*106683*__
[[S:::6375-8446]]__
And we’re not dead—that’s a plus.__
*106684*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s230_060_son:63-1444]]__
There—on the left…__
*106685*__
[[S:::1686-4261]]__
I think we can climb back up to the Realm Travel Room from there!__
*106686*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s230_070_mmr:60-2452]]__
Oh! He’s right, you know—I see it too.__
*106687*__
[[S:::2779-4800]]__
A place to climb up, back where you did the flipping.__
*106688*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s230_080_kra:37-2502]]__
Mm… a climb, you say?__
*106689*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s230_090_mmr:25-1500]]__
Aye, by the statues.__
*106690*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s240_010_son:21-5196]]__
See that, Mimir? Nobody could do all this alone. All these obstacles…__
*106691*__
[[S:::5380-14145]]__
they’re just chances to prove we’re the ones who can beat them. We may argue… me and father, you and Freya, Brok and Sindri…__
*106692*__
[[S:::15048-20033]]__
but when we all work together, we DO make a good team… and that’s Týr’s test.__
*106693*__
[[S:::20495-22645]]__
That’s why we’re gonna make it to Jötunheim.__
*106694*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s240_020_mmr:30-3250]]__
Do you hear that, brother? Lad’s found his equilibrium.__
*106695*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s240_030_son:140-1000]]__
What’s that mean?__
*106696*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s240_040_kra:0-2190]]__
He means you speak wisely, Atreus.__
*106697*__
[[S:::2910-4250]]__
And that is good to hear.__
*106698*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl14_s580_010_kra_stem:2310-2880]]__
Boy.__
*106699*__
[[S:::3590-4040]]__
The head…__
*106700*__
[[S:::4770-5440]]__
get ready.__
*106701*__
[[S:::29130-29910]]__
Now, boy!__
*106702*__
[[S:::48020-48970]]__
We must be close.__
*106703*__
[[S:::53510-54350]]__
We will see.__
*106704*__
[[S:::77750-78250]]__
True.__
*106705*__
[[S:::79100-80260]]__
But if someone were to find you—__
*106706*__
[[S:::99550-101996]]__
Watch the head ’til we return.__
*106707*__
[[S:::112659-113869]]__
Ready?__
*106708*__
[[S:::116082-116988]]__
Come.__
*106709*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl14_s580_010_son_stem:6760-7510]]__
Oh, right.__
*106710*__
[[S:::9225-9715]]__
Got him.__
*106711*__
[[S:::11565-14095]]__
Let’s hope this doesn’t cause you to explode or anything.__
*106712*__
[[S:::18623-20323]]__
Nah. I’m sure you’ll be fine.__
*106713*__
[[S:::21051-21744]]__
Ready!__
*106714*__
[[S:::41707-42234]]__
Look.__
*106715*__
[[S:::49853-53371]]__
Well… what are we waiting for? You think it’s far?__
*106716*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl14_s580_010_mmr_stem:14060-18446]]__
Oh. Hadn’t considered that. Maybe we should talk about this a bit more.__
*106717*__
[[S:::23477-25753]]__
Ooh—that’s unpleasant!__
*106718*__
[[S:::63390-65923]]__
A word, please, before we continue…__
*106719*__
[[S:::69021-73445]]__
Listen the last thing you two need up there’s a decomposing head ruining the moment.__
*106720*__
[[S:::73747-75553]]__
Why don’t I wait for you here.__
*106721*__
[[S:::75761-77817]]__
This is between you and the boy.__
*106722*__
[[S:::93391-97524]]__
Oh-no, no, no, no, no, no.__
*106723*__
[[S:::97716-99762]]__
Fine, damn it, FINE.__
*106724*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl14_s580_010_brk_stem:80000-83150]]__
By Lady Sif’s soft, perfect sloshers!__
*106725*__
[[S:::83820-85601]]__
You done did it!__
*106726*__
[[S:::108488-110428]]__
Okay?__
*106727*__
[[S::vo_lvl_cl14_s580_010_sin_stem:86430-87385]]__
Sorry.__
*106728*__
[[S:::87580-89056]]__
We had to see this.__
*106729*__
[[S:::103070-103700]]__
I can do this.__
*106730*__
[[S:::104390-105705]]__
No… No, I can’t.__
*106731*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl14_s010_010_son:2-2672]]__
Here we go! I can’t believe we’re gonna see the Giants.__
*106732*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl14_s010_020_mmr:110-2250]]__
Well, if things work according to plan… (clears throat)__
*106733*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl14_s020_010_mmr:120-2750]]__
Brother, the way to Jötunheim’s back in the Realm Travel Room.__
*106734*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl14_s020_020_kra:140-3090]]__
We do not know what resistance we will face when we return.__
*106735*__
[[S:::4040-6250]]__
Best to conclude our outstanding business now.__
*106736*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl14_s020_030_mmr:120-1000]]__
Reasonable enough…__
*106737*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl14_s030_010_mmr:140-2621]]__
Go ahead and lock in Jötunheim and we’ll be on our way.__
*106738*__
[[S:::3283-3832]]__
Probably.__
*106739*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl14_s040_010_brk:0-2250]]__
Boy, do I have plans for you.__
*106740*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl14_s040_020_mmr:140-1750]]__
Do hurry back! Please?!__
*106741*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl14_s040_030_brk:0-2250]]__
Don’t flatter yourself, goat-boy.__
*106742*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl14_s005_010_son:120-1700]]__
Why did Baldur say we cost him?__
*106743*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl14_s005_020_mmr:100-5000]]__
Odin must have convinced him that following you to Jötunheim would bring his cure. Lies, I’m sure.__
*106744*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl14_s005_030_son:100-1940]]__
Why did Mistletoe break the spell?__
*106745*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl14_s005_040_mmr:120-3907]]__
Vanir magic is powerful, but its rules are slippery and elusive.__
*106746*__
[[S:::4180-5985]]__
I’m sure it makes sense if you’re a witch.__
*106747*__
[[S:::6222-11606]]__
Oh, but it’s all so bloody tragic… Baldur was the greatest gift Odin granted Freya;__
*106748*__
[[S:::11845-17649]]__
the one thing she treasured from their marriage. She only hoped to spare him pain, and spare herself loss—__
*106749*__
[[S:::18115-22425]]__
but such impulses can lead good parents to make terribly stupid decisions.__
*106750*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s015_010_son:44-2109]]__
Funny… I used to dream about getting eaten.__
*106751*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clsb_s015_020_kra:50-1000]]__
Dreams are nothing to f—__
*106752*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s015_030_son:40-3988]]__
I’m not afraid. It just reminded me of a way I used to feel. When I was a child.__
*106753*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s015_040_son:37-954]]__
Let’s find that statue.__
*106754*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s040_010_son:52-4196]]__
Ouch… the water kind of burns in here. That is water, isn’t it?__
*106755*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s040_020_mmr:118-2129]]__
Aye… most of it...__
*106756*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s045_010_mmr:32-4302]]__
Huh. Smell’s not as bad as I thought it’d be. A bit like heather ale fermenting.__
*106757*__
[[S:::4751-6508]]__
Rather pleasant, actually.__
*106758*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s045_020_son:0-920]]__
You’re so weird.__
*106759*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clsb_s050_010_kra:40-1362]]__
There—the hammer.__
*106760*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s050_020_son:0-2387]]__
Mimir… any idea where Odin hid your eye?__
*106761*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s050_030_mmr:30-600]]__
No.__
*106762*__
[[S:::1000-2630]]__
It’s not like I can still see through it.__
*106763*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s060_010_mmr:20-1250]]__
Maybe if that was closer….__
*106764*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s060_020_mmr:40-1000]]__
Not gonna make that…__
*106765*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s060_030_mmr:50-1590]]__
We’re not reaching that platform…__
*106766*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s060_040_son:74-2011]]__
Mm… didn’t say where we could reach it…__
*106767*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s060_050_son:39-1035]]__
Freeze it there and we’re good!__
*106768*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s060_060_son:20-412]]__
Why…?__
*106769*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s060_070_son:37-1566]]__
I don’t think that ever got close enough.__
*106770*__
[[S:::1979-2777]]__
But I feel like it could.__
*106771*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s060_080_son:19-723]]__
Forget something?__
*106772*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clsb_s070_010_kra:22-1171]]__
Something inside…__
*106773*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s070_020_son:0-1404]]__
Yep. That’s an eye.__
*106774*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s070_030_mmr:40-1500]]__
Gently now, gently…__
*106775*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s070_040_mmr:0-2640]]__
Maybe you should stick that in my head for safe keeping.__
*106776*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s070_050_mmr:40-910]]__
Thank you, brother.__
*106777*__
[[S:::1430-3750]]__
You don’t miss depth until it’s gone.__
*106778*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s080_010_son:0-854]]__
How’s it feel, Mimir?__
*106779*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s080_020_mmr:28-3948]]__
Well, I wouldn’t say I’m feeling whole again, but it’s a right improvement.__
*106780*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clsb_s080_030_kra:50-1368]]__
The Bifröst is intact?__
*106781*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s080_040_mmr:65-1069]]__
It’ll serve.__
*106782*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clsb_s080_050_kra:60-1509]]__
Then we have all we need.__
*106783*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s080_060_son:63-3555]]__
Finally, we’re going to Jötunheim. There’s no stopping us now.__
*106784*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s080_070_mmr:60-2750]]__
Laddy, have you ever heard the term “tempting fate”..?__
*106785*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s080_080_son:0-2000]]__
Fate is another lie told by the gods.__
*106786*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s080_090_mmr:20-1520]]__
… told by the gods, yes, of course.__
*106787*__
[[S:::2060-4000]]__
You really are your father’s son, you know.__
*106788*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s080_090_mmr_a:80-4500]]__
… told by the gods, yes, of course. You really are your father’s son, you know.__
*106789*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_010_son:0-1184]]__
So how do we get back out?__
*106790*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_020_kra:40-766]]__
We signal the—__
*106791*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_030_mmr:22-800]]__
What’s going on?!__
*106792*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_040_kra:28-762]]__
Hold on.__
*106793*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_041_mmr:40-5285]]__
Well that was mildly terrifying. Maybe our presence is upsetting Jörmungandr’s belly?__
*106794*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_042_kra:0-567]]__
No.__
*106795*__
[[S:::1010-2259]]__
Something is wrong.__
*106796*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_050_son:23-894]]__
What’s happening to him?!__
*106797*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_051_mmr:22-770]]__
Nothing good!__
*106798*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_60_mmr:17-986]]__
Glad that’s over.__
*106799*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_110_son:51-1843]]__
Is he getting hit? What is that?__
*106800*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_111_kra:30-750]]__
We must hurry.__
*106801*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_112_mmr:21-1344]]__
Couldn’t agree more, brother.__
*106802*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_120_kra:0-1750]]__
Hold tight and watch your balance!__
*106803*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_130_mmr:15-1474]]__
The boat’s shifting! I’m gonna—__
*106804*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_140_kra:44-775]]__
I have you!__
*106805*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s540_010_kra_stem:22110-23659]]__
Boy?__
*106806*__
[[S:::23659-25095]]__
BOY!__
*106807*__
[[S:::38136-39250]]__
No.__
*106808*__
[[S:::39370-40895]]__
Something else...__
*106809*__
[[S:::43340-44260]]__
The dead Giant...__
*106810*__
[[S:::47380-49868]]__
why would the serpent leave us here?__
*106811*__
[[S:::67930-71077]]__
Until we know for certain... keep your distance.__
*106812*__
[[S:::76710-78635]]__
You are far from home.__
*106813*__
[[S:::86514-88313]]__
You do not know where he is then?__
*106814*__
[[S:::215204-223522]]__
This path you walk… vengeance. You will find no peace. I know.__
*106815*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s540_010_son_stem:25186-28778]]__
Pffah—! I’m good...__
*106816*__
[[S:::29274-30741]]__
Think I’m getting kind of used to this.__
*106817*__
[[S:::34095-36984]]__
What happened to him? Something we did?__
*106818*__
[[S:::52030-52895]]__
Look.__
*106819*__
[[S:::63282-67258]]__
Freya. We can still trust her... right?__
*106820*__
[[S:::74873-76142]]__
We hoped you would know.__
*106821*__
[[S:::99407-100591]]__
When'd you see him last?__
*106822*__
[[S:::116666-117427]]__
There!__
*106823*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s540_010_fre_stem:70660-72532]]__
The World Serpent...__
*106824*__
[[S:::72610-74259]]__
what's happened here?__
*106825*__
[[S:::78640-80419]]__
I’m looking for my son.__
*106826*__
[[S:::80880-82429]]__
The two of you...__
*106827*__
[[S:::83430-85735]]__
you helped me see things more clearly.__
*106828*__
[[S:::88390-89543]]__
No.__
*106829*__
[[S:::89860-93132]]__
But the woods and fields speak his name.__
*106830*__
[[S:::93190-95331]]__
I know he walks here in Midgard.__
*106831*__
[[S:::101780-103343]]__
Long ago...__
*106832*__
[[S:::103770-106009]]__
before you were even born.__
*106833*__
[[S:::107110-109604]]__
Why are you standing so far from me?__
*106834*__
[[S:::111210-112741]]__
What's wrong?__
*106835*__
[[S:::113750-115566]]__
Something’s happened…__
*106836*__
[[S:::144995-146351]]__
My boy...__
*106837*__
[[S:::155734-157162]]__
I’m here.__
*106838*__
[[S:::157162-159037]]__
Don’t run away.__
*106839*__
[[S:::167024-169193]]__
I know that you’re still angry.__
*106840*__
[[S:::169193-173364]]__
I know that how you feel hasn’t changed, but I want you to—__
*106841*__
[[S:::211552-214192]]__
No! Back off, Kratos. This has nothing to do—__
*106842*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s540_010_bld_stem:125524-132866]]__
I had a feeling that hurting the big snake would bring the two of you out in the open.__
*106843*__
[[S:::132960-137425]]__
Do you have any idea, any idea at all,__
*106844*__
[[S:::137490-140114]]__
what you have cost me?__
*106845*__
[[S:::152720-154366]]__
Mother?__
*106846*__
[[S:::162246-166100]]__
Oh, I’m not going anywhere, mother.__
*106847*__
[[S:::173525-175449]]__
How I feel?__
*106848*__
[[S:::176163-177774]]__
How I feel?!__
*106849*__
[[S:::182182-188365]]__
I've spent the last one hundred years dreaming of this moment.__
*106850*__
[[S:::188536-193605]]__
I’ve rehearsed everything I ever wanted to say to you, every word,__
*106851*__
[[S:::193615-198317]]__
to make you understand exactly what you stole from me.__
*106852*__
[[S:::201819-209198]]__
But now I realize... I don’t need you to understand anything.__
*106853*__
[[S:::209198-211552]]__
I don’t need you at all.__
*106854*__
[[S:::226386-234494]]__
You… I’ll deal with you later. But family first.__
*106855*__
[[S:::244751-246423]]__
This again.__
*106856*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s550_010_bld_stem:10439-12916]]__
You might want to turn away, boy.__
*106857*__
[[S:::13420-15162]]__
This won’t be pretty.__
*106858*__
[[S:::18991-19993]]__
Fine.__
*106859*__
[[S:::41843-43934]]__
What is this?__
*106860*__
[[S:::49250-51637]]__
I can feel this...__
*106861*__
[[S:::58211-60811]]__
I can feel everything!__
*106862*__
[[S:::79089-82706]]__
No! Mother!__
*106863*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s550_010_son_stem:16407-17349]]__
I won’t let you hurt him.__
*106864*__
[[S:::32814-34366]]__
Not… my blood…__
*106865*__
[[S:::67347-69342]]__
He’s— vulnerable now?__
*106866*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s550_010_kra_stem:17332-18483]]__
No, boy...__
*106867*__
[[S:::19990-20630]]__
STOP!!!__
*106868*__
[[S:::21260-22120]]__
NO!!__
*106869*__
[[S:::23040-23540]]__
No...__
*106870*__
[[S:::23840-24440]]__
Atreus…__
*106871*__
[[S:::25370-25960]]__
you’re bleeding.__
*106872*__
[[S:::26830-27410]]__
Breathe, boy…__
*106873*__
[[S:::27910-28500]]__
Breathe!__
*106874*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s550_010_fre_stem:62139-64149]]__
NO!!__
*106875*__
[[S:::86106-88148]]__
YOU WILL NOT DO THIS!!!__
*106876*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s570_010_bld_stem:3685-5250]]__
Come on…__
*106877*__
[[S:::7888-9619]]__
do it.__
*106878*__
[[S:::50496-54591]]__
Just can’t help yourself,__
*106879*__
[[S:::55708-57030]]__
can you mother?__
*106880*__
[[S:::58530-60222]]__
No matter what__
*106881*__
[[S:::60222-62027]]__
what I do or say,__
*106882*__
[[S:::62680-63874]]__
you won’t__
*106883*__
[[S:::64962-70220]]__
you won’t stop interfering in my life.__
*106884*__
[[S:::91576-92973]]__
No.__
*106885*__
[[S:::94320-95250]]__
No.__
*106886*__
[[S:::97073-98401]]__
We can’t.__
*106887*__
[[S:::100106-103357]]__
Because I will never forgive you.__
*106888*__
[[S:::106252-111613]]__
You still need to pay for the lifetime that you stole from me.__
*106889*__
[[S:::145257-146530]]__
I know.__
*106890*__
[[S:::175279-178688]]__
Why… why do you even care? You__
*106891*__
[[S:::178688-181351]]__
You could have… walked away.__
*106892*__
[[S:::196195-198101]]__
Snow…__
*106893*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s570_010_fre_stem:9719-12132]]__
Stop… please…__
*106894*__
[[S:::27705-29698]]__
I don’t need your protection.__
*106895*__
[[S:::70220-72717]]__
I was just trying to protect you.__
*106896*__
[[S:::72717-73662]]__
I was…__
*106897*__
[[S:::78980-80020]]__
I’ve made mistakes,__
*106898*__
[[S:::80570-81210]]__
I know…__
*106899*__
[[S:::82370-83720]]__
but you’re free now.__
*106900*__
[[S:::84520-86070]]__
You have what you want.__
*106901*__
[[S:::87460-90590]]__
Try to find forgiveness, we can build something new.__
*106902*__
[[S:::111740-114262]]__
I have paid…__
*106903*__
[[S:::115579-117228]]__
I have paid.__
*106904*__
[[S:::123524-126914]]__
But if that alone will make you whole…__
*106905*__
[[S:::129592-133297]]__
if seeing me dead will make things right…__
*106906*__
[[S:::135647-137108]]__
I won’t stop you.__
*106907*__
[[S:::164403-165796]]__
I love you…__
*106908*__
[[S:::204220-208246]]__
No, no, no, no. no. no… My boy… my dear, sweet, boy…__
*106909*__
[[S:::222202-227096]]__
I will rain down every agony,__
*106910*__
[[S:::227925-232105]]__
every violation imaginable, upon you.__
*106911*__
[[S:::233455-236630]]__
I will parade your cold body__
*106912*__
[[S:::237278-238766]]__
from every corner__
*106913*__
[[S:::239046-240616]]__
of every realm,__
*106914*__
[[S:::240890-245187]]__
and feed your soul to the vilest filth in Hel.__
*106915*__
[[S:::245187-247274]]__
That is my promise.__
*106916*__
[[S:::248861-251137]]__
He robbed me of everything!__
*106917*__
[[S:::256453-258575]]__
everything!__
*106918*__
[[S:::264245-265869]]__
You are just an animal…__
*106919*__
[[S:::267709-271700]]__
passing on your cruelty and rage. You will never change.__
*106920*__
[[S:::275509-277074]]__
I know enough.__
*106921*__
[[S:::279186-280342]]__
Does he?__
*106922*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s570_010_son_stem:15490-16518]]__
He’s beaten, father…__
*106923*__
[[S:::17600-18609]]__
not a threat.__
*106924*__
[[S:::157302-159942]]__
What? No! Father…__
*106925*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s570_010_kra_stem:22120-24065]]__
You will not come for us again.__
*106926*__
[[S:::25220-27024]]__
You will not touch her.__
*106927*__
[[S:::181550-183599]]__
The cycle ends here.__
*106928*__
[[S:::183790-186182]]__
We must be better than this.__
*106929*__
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s570_020_kra_stem:11390-12712]]__
Freya…__
*106930*__
[[S:::13700-15527]]__
He chose this.__
*106931*__
[[S:::69170-71394]]__
Then you do not know me.__
*106932*__
[[S:::83911-84965]]__
Boy,__
*106933*__
[[S:::86466-87722]]__
listen close:__
*106934*__
[[S:::90098-92226]]__
I am from a land called Sparta.__
*106935*__
[[S:::94010-97334]]__
I made a deal with a god that cost me my soul.__
*106936*__
[[S:::99025-101151]]__
I killed many who were deserving…__
*106937*__
[[S:::104102-105989]]__
and many who were not.__
*106938*__
[[S:::116052-118366]]__
I killed my father.__
*106939*__
[[S:::138740-139904]]__
No.__
*106940*__
[[S:::141382-144180]]__
We will be the gods we choose to be,__

[[S:::145188-147250]]__
not those who have been.__
*106942*__
[[S:::148974-152769]]__
Who I was is not who you will be.__
*106943*__
[[S:::154645-156118]]__
We must be better.__
*106944*__
[[S:::175021-179172]]__
In her eyes, yes. But she could never make that choice.__
*106945*__
[[S:::185423-188398]]__
We should finish this journey while I still have strength.__

He saved your life!__

[[S:::119765-121495]]__
That was your father in Hel…__
*106948*__
[[S:::125174-126920]]__
Is this what it is to be a god?__
*106949*__
[[S:::129498-130884]]__
Is this how it always ends?__
*106950*__
[[S:::133148-135011]]__
Sons killing their mothers…__

[[S:::135898-137922]]__
their fathers?__

[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s570_020_mmr_stem:171660-172672]]__
Well…__

Fine. But I won’t go far.__

I can reach him!__

No! I can reach him!__

You have to stop fighting!__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_010_son:107-2658]]__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_020_kra:0-460]]__
No.__
*106966*__
[[S:::950-1920]]__
Do you hear the wind?__
*106967*__
[[S:::2430-3250]]__
We are moving.__
*106968*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_030_son:110-652]]__
That arrow…__
*106969*__
[[S:::1427-2195]]__
Baldur punched…__
*106970*__
[[S:::2711-3528]]__
the mistletoe…?__
*106971*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_040_kra:0-1770]]__
In the quiver’s strap, yes.__

Mistletoe harmed him?__

Mistletoe harmed him?__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_050_son:40-1250]]__
Freya said it was wicked…__
*106976*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_060_mmr:0-2500]]__
He’s more than harmed—the spell is broken!__
*106977*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_070_kra:4-1238]]__
He can be killed?__

I’m certain of it.__

No, woman!__

Not evil.__
*107234*__

You killed her son, lad.__

[[S:::4100-5030]]__
Her son.__

The death of a child is not something a parent gets over easily.__

But he was gonna kill her!__

She would have died to see him live.__

So you’d let me kill you?__

She’ll come around.__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc02_s120_050_kra:30-1520]]__
Back to Týr’s temple then.__

One last time.__

Lads! Am I glad to see you.__

[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl15_s010_030_mmr:130-3920]]__

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl15_s010_040_son:87-1106]]__
Where do you want us to take you?__
*107262*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl15_s010_050_mmr:110-3000]]__
How about the warm confines of anywhere-bloody-else?__
*107263*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl15_s020_010_mmr:0-2270]]__
Before we return to Midgard, I should warn you…__
*107264*__
[[S:::2770-8030]]__
more time has passed than you likely realize. And the snowfall that began when you slew Baldur…__
*107265*__
[[S:::8460-10000]]__
it’s become something else—__
*107266*__
[[S:::10510-12000]]__
the stuff of omens.__
*107267*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl15_s020_020_kra:120-2250]]__
Omens? For the coming of winter?__
*107268*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl15_s020_030_mmr:110-1140]]__
Not just any winter,__
*107269*__
[[S:::1560-3970]]__
but a great winter to span three summers—__
*107270*__
[[S:::4630-5540]]__
and when it’s done,__
*107271*__
[[S:::6340-7250]]__
Ragnarök begins.__
*107272*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl15_s020_040_kra:0-700]]__
Ragnarök.__
*107273*__
[[S:::1300-1971]]__
From snow.__
*107274*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl15_s020_050_mmr:0-6140]]__
Aye. Snow, lots more snow, and then the end of the bloody world, in that approximate order.__
*107275*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl15_s020_060_kra:20-1250]]__
Another prophecy…__
*107276*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl15_s020_070_mmr:13-6018]]__
No, brother….Prophecy doesn’t expect this for a hundred more winters at least. You’ve changed something.__
*107277*__
[[S:::6309-8040]]__
Prophecy didn’t count on you.__
*107278*__
[[S::vo_lvl_jtn_s590_010_son_stem:1278-7613]]__

We did.__

[[S:::45168-47936]]__
I have nothing more to hide.__

[[S:::28350-29346]]__
It’s your axe...__
*107290*__
[[S:::30980-31836]]__
It’s mother...__
*107291*__
[[S:::33530-34030]]__
Look...__
*107292*__
[[S:::35860-37640]]__
she’s arguing with a bunch of Giants.__
*107293*__
[[S:::39450-40190]]__
She...__
*107294*__
[[S:::41110-42114]]__
knew Giants?__
*107295*__
[[S:::48417-49549]]__
That’s us...__
*107296*__
[[S:::50484-52669]]__
the first time we met the World Serpent.__
*107297*__
[[S:::54003-54720]]__
But how...?__
*107298*__
[[S:::57704-59064]]__
And our fight with Baldur...__
*107299*__
[[S:::60839-62504]]__
But that just happened.__
*107300*__
[[S:::63998-64829]]__
Wait—__
*107301*__
[[S:::66649-68740]]__
they knew everything that was going to happen.__
*107302*__
[[S:::70503-74361]]__
The dragon in the mountain, the Stone Mason...__
*107303*__
[[S:::75745-77483]]__
All these drawings...__
*107304*__
[[S:::79476-81303]]__
this is our story.__
*107305*__
[[S:::89555-90414]]__
But...__
*107306*__
[[S:::91252-92854]]__
what does it all mean?__
*107307*__
[[S:::101708-102725]]__
You didn’t know...__
*107308*__
[[S:::105550-106567]]__
She was a Giant...__
*107309*__
[[S:::113552-115560]]__
I’m a Giant.__
*107310*__
[[S:::120124-121637]]__
Why didn’t she tell us?__
*107311*__
[[S:::130587-133423]]__
But why not just tell us the truth?__
*107312*__
[[S:::149299-151003]]__
If she had a plan for us...__
*107313*__
[[S:::151661-152939]]__
I trust it.__
*107314*__
[[S:::154103-154877]]__
Whatever it is.__
*107315*__
[[S:::156379-157372]]__
Besides...__
*107316*__
[[S:::159192-160427]]__
she hasn’t been wrong yet.__
*107317*__
[[S:::162441-163067]]__
Come on,__
*107318*__
[[S:::164476-165987]]__
we’re so close to the end now.__
*107319*__
[[S::vo_lvl_jtn_s600_010_kra_stem:81303-82813]]__
No...__
*107320*__
[[S:::85160-86410]]__
This is your story.__
*107321*__
[[S:::93070-96868]]__
That I was not the only parent with secrets...__
*107322*__
[[S:::125419-128674]]__
She sent us here knowing we would find this.__
*107323*__
[[S:::133580-135350]]__
Your mother would have had good reasons.__
*107324*__
[[S:::139790-141890]]__
Baldur was never sent to find me.__
*107325*__
[[S:::143073-145364]]__
He was tracking her all along...__
*107326*__
[[S:::145829-147847]]__
not knowing she was only ashes.__
*107327*__
[[S:::169387-170559]]__
Yes...__
*107328*__
[[S:::173270-175114]]__
Yes, we are.__
*107329*__
[[S::vo_lvl_jtn_s610_010_son_stem:18177-19380]]__
Father?__
*107330*__
[[S:::94620-95795]]__
I love you, mom.__
*107331*__
[[S:::98200-99362]]__
The Giants...__
*107332*__
[[S:::101049-102742]]__
They really are all gone.__
*107333*__
[[S:::104535-106045]]__
There’s nothing for us here...__
*107334*__
[[S:::116917-123507]]__
So… I get that mother was a Giant. Which makes me part Giant and part god.__
*107335*__
[[S:::125412-129620]]__
Right. I guess there’s just one thing I don’t understand...__
*107336*__
[[S:::132483-133834]]__
My name on the wall—__
*107337*__
[[S:::135975-137714]]__
The Giants called me__
*107338*__
[[S:::138291-139467]]__
“Loki”?__
*107339*__
[[S:::154278-155352]]__
But—why?__
*107340*__
[[S::vo_lvl_jtn_s610_010_kra_stem:19800-20602]]__
No.__
*107341*__
[[S:::21500-22510]]__
We do it together,__
*107342*__
[[S:::24670-25330]]__
son.__
*107343*__
[[S:::92421-93799]]__
Goodbye, Faye.__
*107344*__
[[S:::109750-110473]]__
Come.__
*107345*__
[[S:::123360-124919]]__
And part mortal.__
*107346*__
[[S:::142642-144445]]__
Loki?__
*107347*__
[[S:::145938-152759]]__
That was the name your mother wanted for you when you were born. She must have called you that to her people.__
*107348*__
[[S:::157964-162680]]__
A question for another day. Let us go home.__
*107349*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s015_010_son:28-548]]__
Hm…__
*107350*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s015_020_kra:15-512]]__
Boy?__
*107351*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s015_030_son:11-3072]]__
It’s nothing… I just thought I’d hear voices by now.__
*107352*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s010_010_son:40-1200]]__
Look! Do you see that?__
*107353*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s010_020_kra:0-650]]__
See what?__
*107354*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s010_030_son:0-1100]]__
I’m not sure…__
*107355*__
[[S:::1460-3630]]__
I think I see Giants. No…__
*107356*__
[[S:::4360-5220]]__
dead Giants.__
*107357*__
[[S:::5850-7190]]__
This realm feels strange.__
*107358*__
[[S:::7680-8390]]__
It's too quiet.__
*107359*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s020_040_son:20-1750]]__
Hello? Anybody here?__
*107360*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s030_010_kra:40-1250]]__
What is this place?__
*107361*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s030_020_son:60-3250]]__
They must have all come through here when they left Midgard. What was left of them.__
*107362*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s040_010_kra:0-1250]]__
Why carve all these faces?__
*107363*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s040_020_son:0-2690]]__
What if this is all of the Giants that got out of Midgard alive?__
*107364*__
[[S:::3210-4210]]__
Not really many at all…__
*107365*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s050_010_kra:50-1000]]__
Where are they now?__
*107366*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s050_020_son:97-4002]]__
The Giants came back home so they could survive. But I’m not sure they did.__
*107368*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s060_010_son:70-3236]]__
I should feel them… but I don’t. This place is dead.__
*107369*__
[[S:::4069-6549]]__
What happened to them? Why’d mom send us here?__
*107370*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s060_020_kra:0-2750]]__
One question is answered and two more take its place…__
*107371*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s070_010_son:0-2430]]__
Odin and Thor… ruining everything for everybody…__
*107372*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s080_020_son:33-1486]]__
Hunh… who’s the “guardian”…?__
*107373*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s102_010_son:60-640]]__
Look…__
*107374*__
[[S:::1530-2360]]__
it’s mother’s.__
*107375*__
[[S:::2950-3910]]__
She was here.__
*107376*__
[[S:::4760-6890]]__
She saw every step we took before we took it.__
*107377*__
[[S:::7990-9290]]__
Like she was always with us…__
*107378*__
[[S:::10360-11500]]__
watching over us…__
*107379*__
[[S:::12480-13250]]__
leading us home.__
*107380*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s102_020_son:0-750]]__
Let’s finish it.__
*107381*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s090_010_son:0-4290]]__
Guess it all makes sense now. Why she’d want to end up here. Be with her kind.__
*107382*__
[[S:::5280-9096]]__
But… did she know it was going to be like this here? Is this what she wanted us to see?__
*107383*__
[[S:::10170-13000]]__
Did she want us to tell the people, or keep it a secret?__
*107384*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s090_020_kra:70-520]]__
I…__
*107385*__
[[S:::1420-2200]]__
do not know.__
*107386*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s090_030_son:0-750]]__
So what should we do?__
*107387*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s090_040_kra:0-1750]]__
I trust you to decide that.__
*107388*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s090_050_son:0-490]]__
Oh!__
*107389*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s100_010_son:88-4546]]__
So… why’d you want to name me Atreus? I know it can’t be for a god.__
*107391*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s100_020_kra:50-550]]__
Hah.__
*107392*__
[[S:::1220-1720]]__
No.__
*107393*__
[[S:::2250-3180]]__
He was a soldier.__
*107394*__
[[S:::3600-4250]]__
A Spartan.__
*107395*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s100_030_son:43-776]]__
A great warrior?__
*107397*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s100_040_kra:0-1790]]__
All Spartans are great warriors.__
*107398*__
[[S:::2270-3390]]__
We train from birth.__
*107399*__
[[S:::4040-5910]]__
Our lives were discipline, duty,__
*107400*__
[[S:::6420-7720]]__
battle, and death.__
*107401*__
[[S:::8450-11000]]__
Life was grim, and we greeted it grimly.__
*107402*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s100_050_son:42-515]]__
Mm-hmm.__
*107403*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s100_060_kra:0-3000]]__
But Atreus of Sparta was unlike the rest of us.__
*107404*__
[[S:::3750-6490]]__
He wore a smile even in the worst of times.__
*107405*__
[[S:::7280-8440]]__
He was… happy.__
*107406*__
[[S:::9590-10970]]__
He inspired us to hope…__
*107407*__
[[S:::11920-13890]]__
that though we were machines of war,__
*107408*__
[[S:::14640-16260]]__
yet there was humanity in us.__
*107409*__
[[S:::17180-17890]]__
Goodness.__
*107410*__
[[S:::18980-21990]]__
When the day came for him to lay down his life in battle,__
*107411*__
[[S:::22830-26840]]__
his sacrifice saved countless others, and turned the tide in our favor.__
*107412*__
[[S:::28320-33090]]__
I carried him home on his shield, and buried him with all the honors of Spartan custom.__
*107413*__
[[S:::34780-37500]]__
His memory was a comfort in dark times.__
*107414*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s100_070_son:0-2560]]__
Wow. You actually told a good story.__
*107415*__
[[S:::3020-3880]]__
Mimir missed it!__
*107416*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s110_010_son:240-1800]]__
I understand if you want to go home…__
*107417*__
[[S:::2170-5330]]__
but I bet there are still some corrupted Valkyries out there that could be set free.__
*107418*__
[[S:::6390-7450]]__
Some other help people need.__
*107419*__
[[S:::8180-11210]]__
Maybe helping people was part of why mom sent us out here too.__
*107420*__
[[S:::12200-12700]]__
I mean…__
*107421*__
[[S:::13130-14420]]__
what would Atreus of Sparta do?__
*107422*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s110_010_son_a:240-1800]]__
I understand if you want to go home…__
*107423*__
[[S:::2490-2990]]__
but…__
*107424*__
[[S:::3640-6660]]__
maybe helping people was part of why mom sent us out here too.__
*107425*__
[[S:::7640-8140]]__
I mean…__
*107426*__
[[S:::8590-9870]]__
what would Atreus of Sparta do?__
*107427*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s110_020_kra:50-1250]]__
And what would Loki do?__
*107428*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s110_030_son:68-3839]]__
Hunh… that’s a weird name. I’m glad we went with yours.__
*107429*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv08_s010_010_son:15-2635]]__
Uh… is it a good idea coming back here?__
*107430*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv08_s010_020_mmr:0-2923]]__
She’s probably in there planning your demise, brother.__
*107431*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv08_s010_030_son:0-1550]]__
Or bringing Baldur back to life—__
*107432*__
[[S:::2230-3240]]__
like she did you, Mimir.__
*107433*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv08_s010_040_mmr:20-6208]]__
Oh, I’m not alive, lad. I’m reanimated, sure, but make no mistake, I’m still quite dead.__
*107434*__
[[S:::6684-11311]]__
I’ll never be what I once was. She won’t want this for her son, trust me.__
*107435*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv08_s010_050_son:0-840]]__
That’s a relief.__
*107436*__
[[S:::1660-3500]]__
Not the part about you being dead, but,__
*107437*__
[[S:::4210-4650]]__
you know…__
*107438*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s200_010_mmr:60-3500]]__
If you’re thinking about hurling us all into the void, I hope you’re quite sure.__
*107439*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s200_020_son:18-3002]]__
Wasn’t it your idea? Find our own path, right?__
*107440*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s200_030_mmr:40-730]]__
Bollocks…__
*107441*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clfin_s202_005_kra:90-3887]]__
This is where Týr stepped beyond… and the Unity Stone protected him.__
*107442*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clfin_s202_010_kra:30-495]]__
Ready?__
*107443*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s202_020_son:0-370]]__
Ready.__
*107444*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s202_030_mmr:0-2979]]__
Well… if this is it, lads, it’s been an honor.__
*107445*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clfin_s202_040_kra:24-1226]]__
Have faith, Head.__
*107446*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s202_050_son:50-1646]]__
This is incredible!__
*107447*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s202_060_mmr:39-3028]]__
I… thought… there’d… be… a… bridge…!__
*107448*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s210_010_mmr:130-3500]]__
Ach… how can I be so nauseous without a stomach?__
*107449*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s210_020_son:56-1489]]__
Come on, that was great…!__
*107450*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clfin_s210_030_kra:47-508]]__
Look…__
*107451*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s210_040_son:45-2340]]__
The tower! I knew there was something down here…__
*107452*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s210_050_mmr:80-1290]]__
Amazing.__
*107453*__
[[S:::1710-4050]]__
How do you hide something that exists in all realms?__
*107454*__
[[S:::4600-7060]]__
Cast it out of any realm to the space between.__
*107455*__
[[S:::7560-8750]]__
Clever old Týr.__
*107456*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s210_051_son:60-1374]]__
Is Jötunheim on the other side?__
*107457*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s210_052_mmr:130-890]]__
Can’t be that.__
*107458*__
[[S:::1430-4470]]__
It’s not like you go through Vanaheim to reach the Midgard peak.__
*107459*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clfin_s210_060_kra:60-1250]]__
But how do we use it?__
*107460*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s210_070_mmr:0-2878]]__
I’d suggest we look inside. But stay alert—__
*107461*__
[[S:::3198-6319]]__
Týr’s little challenges are never as simple as they appear.__
*107462*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clfin_s210_080_kra:12-1222]]__
I have noticed.__
*107463*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s220_010_mmr:40-590]]__
Well…__
*107464*__
[[S:::990-2000]]__
this is sparse.__
*107465*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clfin_s220_020_kra:70-650]]__
The pedestal…__
*107466*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s220_030_son:90-2134]]__
Oh no! It took the stone!__
*107467*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s220_040_mmr:28-3414]]__
The tower… it’s absorbing the stone’s energy…__
*107468*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s220_041_son:36-4160]]__
Something’s happening! Is it moving? It’s moving!__
*107469*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s220_042_mmr:0-970]]__
It knows what to do.__
*107470*__
[[S:::1580-5000]]__
The stone served its purpose. We’re fulfilling Týr’s spell!__
*107471*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clfin_s220_050_kra:0-750]]__
What happens now?__
*107472*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s220_060_mmr:20-960]]__
No idea, brother…__

Ogre and Troll at the same time. Sure, that’s fair…__

*107492*__
[[S:::2270-3000]]__
where shall we start?__
*107493*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_talks_baldur_020_son:30-710]]__
So, Mimir…__
*107494*__
[[S:::1910-3250]]__
why did Freya spit in your face?__
*107495*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_talks_baldur_030_kra:30-590]]__
No,__
*107496*__
[[S:::1160-2160]]__
speak of Baldur.__
*107497*__
[[S:::2680-4250]]__
He claims nothing harms him.__
*107498*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_talks_baldur_040_mmr:380-5250]]__
Aye, Baldur is blessed with invulnerability to all threats, physical or magical.__
*107499*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_talks_baldur_050_kra:70-1140]]__
The boasting of a god.__
*107500*__
[[S:::1710-2750]]__
Everyone has a weakness.__
*107501*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_talks_baldur_060_mmr:49-5807]]__
Not him, I’m afraid. Baldur is blessed with invulnerability to all threats, physical or magical.__
*107502*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_talks_baldur_070_son:30-1228]]__
You just said that, Mimir.__

[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_talks_baldur_100_mmr:80-1360]]__
Well, as I recall…__
*107506*__
[[S:::2090-3240]]__
it involved… eh… a__
*107507*__
[[S:::3810-4500]]__

*107508*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_talks_baldur_110_son:41-735]]__
Mimir?__

Oh sorry, lad. Losing my concentration a bit.__

That was weird…__
*107514*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_baldur_fact_finding_010_mmr:71-2490]]__
Why don’t you tell me how all this began with Baldur?__
*107515*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_baldur_fact_finding_020_son:20-1250]]__
He just knocked on our door!__
*107516*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_baldur_fact_finding_030_mmr:60-2000]]__
Baldur of Asgard just knocked on your door?__
*107517*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_baldur_fact_finding_040_son:0-2370]]__
Yeah, he just showed up and started a fight.__
*107518*__
[[S:::3060-4600]]__
He said he wanted to know something.__
*107519*__
[[S:::5529-7622]]__
He said “I know what you are”…__
*107520*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_baldur_fact_finding_050_kra:16-683]]__
Mmm.__
*107521*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_baldur_fact_finding_060_mmr:90-640]]__
Oh!__
*107522*__
[[S:::920-2620]]__
Well, we’ll circle back to that later.__
*107523*__
[[S:::3140-4750]]__
What exactly did he want to know?__
*107524*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_baldur_fact_finding_070_son:0-1160]]__
I was under the floor by then…__
*107525*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_baldur_fact_finding_080_kra:40-2290]]__
He said I already knew what he wanted.__
*107526*__
[[S:::2760-4250]]__
Perhaps he mistook me for another.__
*107527*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_baldur_fact_finding_090_mmr:84-2252]]__
Hm. That’s quite interesting.__
*107528*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_inner_light_010_son:130-561]]__
Mimir?__
*107529*__
[[S:::1460-3250]]__
Why do you have Bifröst crystals in your eyes?__
*107530*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_inner_light_020_mmr:50-2139]]__
A loving gift from the Giants.__
*107531*__
[[S:::2378-4983]]__
Since I used to do so much traveling between realms,__
*107532*__
[[S:::5002-8694]]__
they thought it would be more convenient for me than having a crystal I could lose.__
*107533*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_inner_light_030_son:101-627]]__
Did it hurt?__
*107534*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_inner_light_040_mmr:0-5332]]__
No, because I wisely fortified myself with sixteen cups of billow maidens’ ale.__
*107535*__
[[S:::5690-9610]]__
Got so inebriated I tried convincing the Giants to put ’em in my nipples instead!__
*107536*__
[[S:::9824-13063]]__
(Laughing) Almost talked them into it too…__
*107537*__
[[S:::13254-14130]]__
Can you imagine?__
*107538*__
[[S:::14423-17866]]__
Mimir of the Bifröst teats! (Laughing)__
*107539*__
[[S:::17991-19846]]__
Those were the days…__
*107540*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_inner_light_050_son:104-1011]]__
Ewww.__
*107541*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_inner_light_060_mmr:900-3269]]__
Okay, okay… I’ll stop now.__
*107542*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants1_010_son:32-3611]]__
So what do you think, Mimir? What does Baldur want with us?__
*107543*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants1_010_son_a:32-3611]]__
So what do you think, Mimir? What does Baldur want with us?__
*107544*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants1_020_mmr:140-1570]]__
Well… let’s look at what we know.__
*107545*__
[[S:::2400-5150]]__
Baldur is Odin’s finest tracker, bar none.__
*107546*__
[[S:::5550-9330]]__
If he wants you, you have to consider the possibility that Odin wants you.__
*107547*__
[[S:::9790-13250]]__
And as for what Odin wants, on this I have some expertise.__
*107548*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants1_030_son:28-3253]]__
What could WE have that Odin doesn’t? He’s like the king of gods!__
*107549*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants1_040_mmr:220-1500]]__
Of the Aesir, aye,__
*107550*__
[[S:::1880-3430]]__
but his reach is not unlimited.__
*107551*__
[[S:::3800-6860]]__
And where he cannot reach, he is preoccupied with going.__
*107552*__
[[S:::7300-9750]]__
He certainly tortured me enough about it over the years.__
*107553*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants2_010_son:49-835]]__
So…__
*107554*__
[[S:::1771-3473]]__
Odin wants to go where he can’t reach…__
*107555*__
[[S:::4423-6292]]__
are you saying he’s trying to get to Jötunheim too?__
*107556*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants2_020_mmr:110-640]]__
Aye,__
*107557*__
[[S:::1070-3245]]__
it ranks among his foremost obsessions.__
*107558*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants2_030_son:32-540]]__
But…__
*107559*__
[[S:::1096-2487]]__
that doesn’t make any sense, Mimir.__
*107560*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants2_040_mmr:90-590]]__
Oh?__
*107561*__
[[S:::930-2408]]__
When did I stop making sense?__
*107562*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants2_050_son:30-2340]]__
You’re saying Baldur tracked us down to find the way to Jötunheim…__
*107563*__
[[S:::3270-5946]]__
but that was before we knew Jötunheim is where we needed to go!__
*107564*__
[[S:::6988-7857]]__
That’s crazy.__
*107565*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants2_060_mmr:110-1192]]__
Except for one thing…__
*107566*__
[[S:::1508-4287]]__
you are headed for Jötunheim. So he was right.__
*107567*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants2_070_son:20-1000]]__
I’m so confused.__
*107568*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants2_080_mmr:80-1620]]__
Well, then clearly you’ve been listening.__
*107569*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_frigg_revealed_010_son:13-788]]__
I’m confused.__
*107570*__
[[S:::1778-3906]]__
I always heard that Baldur’s mother was Frigg.__
*107571*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_frigg_revealed_020_mmr:280-1240]]__
Aye, Frigg…__
*107572*__
[[S:::1610-3459]]__
well, that’s more of a pet name, you see.__
*107573*__
[[S:::3634-4753]]__
It means, “beloved.”__
*107574*__
[[S:::4962-7489]]__
Something Odin called Freya after they wed.__
*107575*__
[[S:::7770-10370]]__
Out of affection, at first, or so I like to believe.__
*107576*__
[[S:::10850-14250]]__
As things turned sour, it became a way to manipulate the truth.__
*107577*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_frigg_revealed_030_son:0-663]]__
How so?__
*107578*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_frigg_revealed_040_mmr:490-5160]]__
Odin didn’t want Freya, a Vanir goddess, getting credit for anything in Asgard.__
*107579*__
[[S:::5510-8750]]__
So anything worthy she accomplished was attributed to Frigg.__
*107580*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_frigg_revealed_040_mmr_a:50-4578]]__
Odin didn’t want Freya, a Vanir goddess, getting credit for anything in Asgard.__
*107581*__
[[S:::4827-8100]]__
So anything worthy she accomplished was attributed to Frigg.__
*107582*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_frigg_revealed_050_son:30-1250]]__
Like being Baldur’s mother.__
*107583*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_frigg_revealed_060_mmr:180-1320]]__
That’s RIGHT—__
*107584*__
[[S:::1830-4250]]__
Freya was Baldur’s mother all along!__
*107585*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_frigg_revealed_070_son:118-850]]__
(sighs)__
*107586*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_odin_vs_future_010_son:126-575]]__
Okay—__
*107587*__
[[S:::1050-4000]]__
tell me again how Odin knew we were going to Jötunheim before we did.__
*107588*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_odin_vs_future_020_mmr:1250-5740]]__
Odin is extremely clever, you see. Nearly as clever as he thinks he is.__
*107589*__
[[S:::6140-11160]]__
And he’s a collector of prophecies. If it’s about the future, he adds it to his collection.__
*107590*__
[[S:::11590-15260]]__
Helps him style himself as all seeing and all knowing.__
*107591*__
[[S:::15780-17900]]__
But of course the idea is control.__
*107592*__
[[S:::18480-20630]]__
Control of the future, control of his fate…__
*107593*__
[[S:::21040-25650]]__
he’d control every realm of every land in every world if he could.__
*107594*__
[[S:::26130-29500]]__
Every potential pocket of resistance he seeks to eliminate.__
*107595*__
[[S:::29500-33500]]__
Even if you’ve never posed a threat before… he may think one day you might.__
*107596*__
[[S:::33700-40859]]__
So you see… it’s not important how he knew before you did — it’s important that he was right.__
*107597*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_odins_plan_010_mmr:63-3129]]__
Now don’t go spreading it around that I speak the snake’s tongue.__
*107598*__
[[S:::3129-6882]]__
If Odin ever found that out, it’d be dangerous for all concerned.__
*107599*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_odins_plan_020_son:0-4000]]__
Why’s Odin so desperate to find a way into Jötunheim, anyway?__
*107600*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_odins_plan_030_mmr:80-2800]]__
Oh, well, the Giants are the Aesir’s oldest enemies.__
*107601*__
[[S:::2800-6550]]__
They’re fated to wage a successful war against the gods during Ragnarök.__
*107602*__
[[S:::7010-10480]]__
Things don’t end well for him and the Aesir, or even the world for that matter.__
*107603*__
[[S:::10990-14000]]__
Odin hopes to prevent the army of Giants from ever forming.__
*107604*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_odins_plan_040_son:5-6231]]__
But… isn’t Ragnarök what’s fated to happen? You said the World Serpent had already been there.__
*107605*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_odins_plan_050_mmr:60-4080]]__
Oh, even Odin is not so stubborn as to believe he can prevent Ragnarök.__
*107606*__
[[S:::4620-7000]]__
But he does aspire to alter its outcome.__
*107607*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_odins_plan_060_son:5-288]]__
How?__
*107608*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_odins_plan_070_mmr:100-1290]]__
His usual repertoire.__
*107609*__
[[S:::1700-6250]]__
Hoard information, manipulate events, and gradually assume control of the variables.__
*107610*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_odins_plan_080_son:5-788]]__
What’s a variable?__
*107611*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_odins_plan_090_mmr:51-4669]]__
Oh, that’s maths. We’ll cover that later. What I mean is—I’ll give you an example.__
*107612*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_odins_plan_100_kra:0-349]]__
Later.__
*107613*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_odins_plan_110_mmr:130-860]]__
Oh, alright.__
*107614*__
[[S:::1420-3000]]__
Remind me to tell you about the Wolves.__
*107615*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_bewitched_010_kra:20-270]]__
Now,__
*107616*__
[[S:::660-4000]]__
head—why did you not tell us Baldur is the son of Freya?__
*107617*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_bewitched_020_mmr:110-1250]]__
He IS!__
*107618*__
[[S:::1690-5355]]__
It’s shocking every time I hear it. And yet obviously I know it.__

But Baldur is blessed with invulnerability to all threats, physical or magical.__

[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_bewitched_170_son:0-800]]__

[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_talks_magni_010_son:50-1690]]__
So who were those two men with Baldur?__

Are they really the sons of Thor?__

[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_talks_magni_020_mmr:0-1408]]__
Aye, Magni and Modi.__
*107647*__
[[S:::1653-4773]]__
Two bigger twits you won’t likely find in the halls of Asgard.__
*107648*__
[[S:::5187-6965]]__
They’ll do anything their uncle puts them up to.__
*107649*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_talks_magni_030_kra:45-951]]__

[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_talks_magni_040_mmr:50-2090]]__
Well, dangerous fools, to be sure.__

[[S:::2530-4210]]__
When they work together, they’re formidable…__

[[S:::4570-6810]]__
but too often it’s a petty competition.__

[[S:::7250-9170]]__
Terribly strong, even as children.__
*107655*__
[[S:::9560-12750]]__
I remember the time Hrungnir the brawler fell upon Thor—__
*107656*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_talks_magni_050_kra:0-1154]]__
Another time, Head.__

Aw!__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_serpent_history_010_kra:0-1920]]__
What else did the serpent say, Head?__
*107659*__
[[S:::2310-4000]]__
I do not think he would speak idly.__
*107660*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_serpent_history_010_son:0-500]]__
Mimir…__
*107661*__
[[S:::1073-2830]]__
what else did the serpent tell you when you spoke?__
*107662*__
[[S:::3470-4616]]__
Kinda sounded important.__
*107663*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_serpent_history_020_mmr:221-3820]]__
I’m sure it’s nothing. He just said the boy seemed familiar to him.__

[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_serpent_history_040_mmr:60-1260]]__

[[S:::1630-5440]]__
Unless… perhaps… he refers to something yet to be?__
*107668*__
[[S:::6250-10160]]__
It is said that when Jörmungandr and Thor battle at Ragnarök,__

[[S:::10560-14100]]__
their clash so violently shakes the Tree of Life that it splinters,__
*107670*__
[[S:::14490-17789]]__
casting the Serpent backward through time, even before his own birth.__
*107671*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_serpent_history_050_son:68-576]]__
What!__
*107672*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_serpent_history_060_kra:94-1404]]__

Well, I did say not to concern yourself…__
*107674*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_oldest_enemies_010_son:133-2852]]__
Why’s Odin so desperate to find a way into Jötunheim, anyway?__
*107675*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_oldest_enemies_020_mmr:0-5200]]__
He’s convinced the Giants hold the key to changing his fate when Ragnarök comes.__
*107676*__
[[S:::5200-7310]]__
They are the Aesir’s oldest enemies, after all—__
*107677*__
[[S:::7670-11020]]__
and it’s their army that’s supposed to do him in, in the end.__
*107678*__
[[S:::11550-14692]]__
But more than that, he covets their gifts of prophecy.__
*107679*__
[[S:::15100-18070]]__
He wants to know what they know, and see what they see.__
*107680*__
[[S:::18750-25484]]__
So much suffering could have been avoided if his insatiable curiosity was not so much stronger than his wisdom.__
*107681*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_oldest_enemies_030_son:132-730]]__

[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_oldest_enemies_040_mmr:20-720]]__
Ah—__

*107684*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_giants_gone_010_son:40-580]]__
Mimir…__

[[S:::1370-3660]]__
do you know why there are no more Giants left in Midgard?__
*107686*__
[[S:::4300-6230]]__
I mean, not counting the serpent from the future.__
*107687*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_giants_gone_020_mmr:80-5050]]__
Well, they did not take me into their confidence about that, Odin’s convictions to the contrary.__
*107688*__
[[S:::5610-6630]]__
But I know this—__
*107689*__
[[S:::7410-12410]]__
if I’d spent the better part of sixty winters seeing my best and brightest cut down by Thor and__
*107690*__
[[S:::12410-13380]]__
that damn hammer,__
*107691*__
[[S:::13830-16000]]__
I might very well go home to lick my wounds.__
*107692*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_giants_gone_030_mmr:33-3620]]__
It’s too bad. I was fond of every Giant I ever met…__
*107693*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_giants_gone_040_son:270-2440]]__
So that’s why they destroyed the bridges to Jötunheim…__
*107694*__
[[S:::2930-3880]]__
so the Aesir couldn’t follow?__
*107695*__
[[S:::5230-6500]]__
And is that why there’s no tower in the lake?__
*107696*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_giants_gone_050_mmr:0-1500]]__
I doubt it’s a coincidence.__
*107697*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_giants_gone_060_son:37-3154]]__
So you think when we get to Jötunheim, we might find Giants there?__
*107698*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_giants_gone_070_mmr:70-1250]]__
Anything’s possible.__
*107699*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_odin_worldtree_010_son:153-1998]]__

*107700*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_odin_worldtree_020_mmr:16-3224]]__
That refers to a modest example of Odin’s thirst for knowledge—__
*107701*__
[[S:::3397-5512]]__
the time he spent nine days a dead man.__
*107702*__
[[S:::5812-8194]]__
Hung himself by the neck from Yggdrasil’s branches,__
*107703*__
[[S:::8268-11970]]__
put his spear through his own side, and bled down into the Well of Destiny.__

[[S:::12276-16370]]__
He roamed the realms of the dead and plundered the World Tree of its secrets…__

until, I think quite rightly, it got fed up with him and sent him back to the land of the living.__

[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_odin_worldtree_020_mmr_a:16-3269]]__

[[S:::3428-5614]]__
the time he spent nine days a dead man.__

[[S:::5832-9005]]__
Aye! Hung himself by the neck from Yggdrasil’s branches,__

[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_nothing_written_010_son:118-1399]]__
Here’s something I can’t figure out…__
*107715*__
[[S:::1977-3408]]__
Odin wants to prevent Ragnarök…__
*107716*__
[[S:::4123-5961]]__
but the Serpent’s already been there and seen it.__
*107717*__
[[S:::6826-7835]]__
So hasn’t he already failed?__
*107718*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_nothing_written_020_mmr:30-1400]]__
Fate’s a tricky thing, lad.__
*107719*__
[[S:::1880-5114]]__
And Odin’s just arrogant enough to think he can get the best of it.__
*107720*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_nothing_written_030_kra:178-2299]]__
Fate is another lie told by the gods.__

Nothing is written that cannot be unwritten.__
*107722*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_nothing_written_040_mmr:40-3060]]__
On that, brother, you and the Allfather may just agree.__

Even if he can’t prevent Ragnarök, he still hopes to learn enough details to influence the outcome.__

[[S:::2964-6185]]__
They’re quite famous, or infamous, depending on your point of view.__

[[S:::6920-9435]]__
They crafted Mjölnir, you see—Thor’s Hammer?__

The Aesir’s greatest murder weapon, the bane of Giant-kind…__
*107732*__
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_mjolnir_lore_030_son:40-1240]]__
THEY made Thor’s hammer?__

Laufey was a rumor in the halls of Asgard—__

a Giantess warrior who thwarted many an Aesir god’s plans.__

[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_freya_stop_060_kra:0-1250]]__
What did you tell her?__
*107805*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_freya_stop_070_mmr:0-3360]]__
What little I know about where Odin may have kept her Valkyrie wings.__
*107806*__
[[S:::3780-6956]]__
Seems she’s rather bent on reclaiming her warrior spirit.__
*107807*__
[[S:::7550-11507]]__
I’m afraid the cycle of vengeance may not be so easily broken.__
*107808*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s005_010_son:0-530]]__
Wait…__
*107809*__
[[S:::1250-4800]]__
the voice, from the sword… it says we can go this way!__
*107810*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s005_020_son:0-500]]__
Come on…__
*107811*__
[[S:::900-2150]]__
let’s pick up where we left off.__
*107812*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s005_030_son:63-2098]]__
This way! It’ll save time.__
*107813*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010a_010_son:0-688]]__
Wow…__
*107814*__
[[S:::1510-2550]]__
it’s hot here.__
*107815*__
[[S:::3300-3800]]__
But…__
*107816*__
[[S:::4730-6058]]__
is that… snow?__
*107817*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s010a_020_kra:70-710]]__
Ash.__
*107818*__
[[S:::1300-3569]]__
It only falls like that for great fires.__
*107819*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s010a_030_mmr:100-6775]]__
The whole realm is a great fire… the source of fire itself, and all the sun and stars, if legend is to be believed.__
*107820*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010a_040_son:30-990]]__
Should we believe?__
*107821*__
[[S:::1650-2150]]__
I mean…__
*107822*__
[[S:::2710-3480]]__
we’re here,__
*107823*__
[[S:::4030-5057]]__
and we’re not on fire.__
*107824*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s010a_050_kra:9-872]]__
Not yet.__
*107825*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s010a_060_mmr:20-4656]]__
Well, you know… I suppose it’s cooled considerably since the dawn of creation, hasn’t it?__
*107826*__
[[S:::5226-7902]]__
Niflheim isn’t exactly ice these days either.__
*107827*__
[[S:::8172-9440]]__
It’s in the nature of things–__
*107828*__
[[S:::9735-11963]]__
extremes are tempered by time.__
*107829*__
[[S:::12322-15380]]__
Fires burn colder, men grow old and gray…__
*107830*__
[[S:::15567-18892]]__
heads are chopped off and attached to belts. Such is life!__
*107831*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010a_070_son:20-2406]]__
Uh… okay, Mimir…__
*107832*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010b_010_son:40-460]]__
Wow…__
*107833*__
[[S:::1510-2530]]__
it’s hot here.__
*107834*__
[[S:::3300-3800]]__
But…__
*107835*__
[[S:::4730-6045]]__
is that… snow?__
*107836*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s010b_020_kra:70-700]]__
Ash.__
*107837*__
[[S:::1300-3533]]__
It only falls like that for great fires.__
*107838*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010b_030_son:0-773]]__
Well…__
*107839*__
[[S:::773-3623]]__
this is supposed to be the greatest fire of all, isn’t it?__
*107840*__
[[S:::4515-7500]]__
Muspelheim, the ancient realm of flame…__
*107841*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s010b_040_kra:0-1372]]__
Did your mother speak of it?__
*107842*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010b_050_son:50-950]]__
Not a whole lot.__
*107843*__
[[S:::1540-2340]]__
I mean…__
*107844*__
[[S:::2340-4890]]__
there’s not many stories that take place in… fire.__
*107845*__
[[S:::5640-8030]]__
Except among the fire giants, I guess.__
*107846*__
[[S:::8997-11089]]__
But I don’t think they talk to others much.__
*107847*__
[[S:::11440-13128]]__
And no one’s seen one in forever…__
*107848*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010b_060_son:20-1750]]__
I wonder what Surtr’s Gauntlet is…__
*107849*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s010b_070_kra:0-450]]__
What?__
*107850*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s010b_070_kra_a:0-570]]__
What?__
*107851*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010b_080_son:123-1611]]__
It’s what those runes said we could find here.__
*107852*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s010b_090_kra:13-2370]]__
Hm… we shall look.__
*107853*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010c_010_son:70-600]]__
Oh…__
*107854*__
[[S:::1230-3250]]__
you just feel like a long walk in the heat, I guess.__
*107855*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010c_020_son:0-524]]__
Really?__
*107856*__
[[S:::1230-3002]]__
Shouldn’t we save our strength for the challenge?__
*107857*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010c_020_son_a:60-567]]__
Really?__
*107858*__
[[S:::1200-3000]]__
Shouldn’t we save our strength for the challenge?__
*107859*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010c_030_son:50-1250]]__
Did you forget the shortcut?__
*107860*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010c_040_son:50-1317]]__
Why wouldn’t we use the shortcut?__
*107861*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010c_050_son:60-1803]]__
You wanna go this way again?__
*107862*__
[[S:::2490-3150]]__
Oh, boy…__
*107863*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010c_060_son:50-2150]]__
You know we don’t have to go this way, right?__
*107864*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s015_010_son:120-693]]__
Listen…__
*107865*__
[[S:::1580-2527]]__
I hear a voice…__
*107866*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s015_020_kra:30-800]]__
Another elf?__
*107867*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s015_030_son:70-1058]]__
I don’t think so…__
*107868*__
[[S:::1920-2920]]__
it’s coming from up there…__
*107869*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s015_040_son:0-2505]]__
Oh…! I mean besides Brok…__
*107870*__
[[S:::3100-4660]]__
up there! To the right…!__
*107871*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s015_050_son:0-1397]]__
You must like the heat, Brok…__
*107872*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s020_010_son:50-616]]__
Mimir,__
*107873*__
[[S:::1440-3100]]__
did you ever hear of Surtr’s Gauntlet?__
*107874*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s020_020_mmr:0-1138]]__
Not as such.__
*107875*__
[[S:::1311-3884]]__
But it sounds like the Fire Giant’s training ground,__
*107876*__
[[S:::4000-6689]]__
where he kept himself in fighting shape for Ragnarök.__
*107877*__
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_mus_s020_030_mmr:0-2050]]__
I can tell you all about Surtr sometime,__
*107878*__
[[S:::2281-5156]]__
when we’ve got a nice boat ride and not everything is on fire.__
*107879*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s020_040_son:40-3383]]__
So how do we know Surtr didn’t go to Jötunheim with the rest of the Giants?__
*107880*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s020_050_mmr:50-3080]]__
Well, why would he? He’s a pre-Bergelmirian Giant.__
*107881*__
[[S:::3520-5960]]__
Muspel was his home long before the flood.__
*107882*__
[[S:::6340-10000]]__
It’s better this way, both for him, and for everything not on fire.__
*107883*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s020_060_son:90-750]]__
Oofta… !__
*107884*__
[[S:::1580-2940]]__
I forgot how hot it was here.__
*107885*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s020_070_mmr:40-2290]]__
Well, it is a realm of primordial fire.__
*107886*__
[[S:::2690-5500]]__
If it weren’t a little balmy, I’d be concerned.__
*107887*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s020_080_son:0-500]]__
Oh,__
*107888*__
[[S:::1130-2580]]__
I am not getting used to the heat…__
*107889*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s020_090_mmr:50-1742]]__
Wait ’til you have a beard to singe…__
*107890*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s020_100_son:54-1905]]__
Ugh… there’s that heat again.__
*107891*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s020_110_mmr:30-1992]]__
Aye, but it’s a dry heat…__
*107892*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s025_010_son:60-872]]__
Oh wow.__
*107893*__
[[S:::1342-2618]]__
It’s a lava waterfall.__
*107894*__
[[S:::3421-4275]]__
It’s a lava-fall.__
*107895*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s025_020_mmr:45-2157]]__
Yes, this isn’t at ALL terrifying, is it?__
*107896*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s025_030_son:66-2196]]__
Oop! There goes my arm-hair.__
*107897*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s025_040_mmr:32-1715]]__
Oh… do be careful.__
*107898*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s030_010_son:57-2516]]__
The voice! It’s just around this corner…__
*107899*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s030_011_son:0-577]]__
Oh!…__
*107900*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s030_020_son:40-1254]]__
…it’s a great big sword.__
*107901*__
[[S:::2400-4137]]__
It wants to know if we’re ready to train?__
*107902*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s030_030_son:53-3503]]__
There’s another sword! This must be the next challenge.__
*107903*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s030_040_son:47-7144]]__
Another sword! I wonder how many of these there are. Oh, it’s six. The voice says six.__
*107904*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s030_050_son:132-1108]]__
Found the next sword!__
*107905*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s030_060_son:42-3391]]__
There’s a sword! What’s this, the fifth?__
*107906*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_010_son:90-2180]]__
It says there’s another level to this challenge –__
*107907*__
[[S:::3140-4250]]__
harder than before….__
*107908*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_020_son:52-2674]]__
Now it wants to know if we’re ready for the ultimate challenge!__
*107909*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_030_kra:39-1773]]__
It is not the time for this.__
*107910*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_040_son:26-723]]__
Aw…__
*107911*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s035_050_mmr:30-2474]]__
Ah, out here just to breathe the ash, then…__
*107912*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_060_kra:20-615]]__
No.__
*107913*__
[[S:::930-1642]]__
Not now.__
*107914*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_070_son:40-640]]__
Okay…__
*107915*__
[[S:::1370-2250]]__
what are we doin’ then?__
*107916*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_080_kra:0-1512]]__
We do not need this now.__
*107917*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_090_son:20-908]]__
Whatever you say…__
*107918*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_100_kra:0-480]]__
No.__
*107919*__
[[S:::910-2290]]__
Our journey awaits…__
*107920*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_110_son:60-620]]__
’kay then.…__
*107921*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_120_son:50-1054]]__
The gate’s closed…!__
*107922*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_130_kra:30-1162]]__
Prepare yourself, boy.__
*107923*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_140_son:28-605]]__
Yes sir!__
*107924*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_150_kra:0-1068]]__
Be ready, boy.__
*107925*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_160_son:0-500]]__
I am!__
*107926*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_170_kra:30-750]]__
Here they come.__
*107927*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_180_son:0-500]]__
I’m ready!__
*107928*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_190_kra:98-929]]__
It begins.__
*107929*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_200_son:27-779]]__
Here we go…!__
*107930*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_210_kra:0-500]]__
Ready?__
*107931*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_220_son:30-500]]__
Ready!__
*107932*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s035_230_mmr:1840-3750]]__
Ehhhh… oh! You meant the boy, of course.__
*107933*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_240_kra:0-750]]__
Follow my lead.__
*107934*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_250_son:49-816]]__
Say the word…__
*107935*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_260_kra:30-967]]__
We go again.__
*107936*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_270_son:30-500]]__
Sir!__
*107937*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_280_kra:30-750]]__
Once more.__
*107938*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_290_son:73-907]]__
Let’s do it!__
*107939*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_300_kra:50-719]]__
Again.__
*107940*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_310_son:50-600]]__
Why not..!__
*107941*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_320_kra:0-1049]]__
One more time.__
*107942*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_330_son:44-1270]]__
Okay, I’m ready…__
*107943*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_010_son:30-710]]__
It stopped.__
*107944*__
[[S:::1690-2250]]__
We failed?__
*107945*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s040_020_kra:0-1790]]__
There is no failure in training.__
*107946*__
[[S:::2420-4250]]__
We can surpass it with practice.__
*107947*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_030_son:0-568]]__
Sure,__
*107948*__
[[S:::1010-2750]]__
or we could come back with better weapons and armor.__
*107949*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s040_040_mmr:0-1038]]__
A fair point.__
*107950*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_050_son:20-4041]]__
Hmph…. Think we can beat it, or do we need better gear?__
*107951*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_060_son:70-1746]]__
I feel like maybe we’ll be better at that…__
*107952*__
[[S:::2260-2750]]__
later.__
*107953*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_070_son:50-939]]__
We lost again?__
*107954*__
[[S:::2020-2710]]__
I dunno,__
*107955*__
[[S:::3300-4210]]__
can we do this?__
*107956*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_080_son:90-604]]__
Okay,__
*107957*__
[[S:::1100-1930]]__
what are we doing wrong?__
*107958*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_090_son:80-3000]]__
Why can’t we do this? Would some better gear help?__
*107959*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_090_son_a:70-2900]]__
Why can’t we do this? Would some better gear help?__
*107960*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_100_son:60-3112]]__
I know this is training… but it still hurts.__
*107961*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_110_son:30-737]]__
Aww…__
*107962*__
[[S:::1240-2336]]__
we were close that time!__
*107963*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_120_son:29-1135]]__
We had that…__
*107964*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_130_son:33-2350]]__
Ugh… all that for nothing!__
*107965*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_140_son:120-800]]__
Oh no!__
*107966*__
[[S:::1410-2250]]__
I thought we had it…!__
*107967*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_150_son:147-2229]]__
Aw, man… almost!__
*107968*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s040_160_mmr:0-1880]]__
Well… this seems frustrating…__
*107969*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_170_son:50-550]]__
Boy,__
*107970*__
[[S:::1110-2622]]__
we didn’t come CLOSE that time.__
*107971*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_180_son:39-1558]]__
I’m not sure we’re ready for that one.__
*107972*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_190_son:31-2015]]__
That’s not fair–we weren’t ready.__
*107973*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_200_son:50-1650]]__
I’m not sure we have the right gear for this.__
*107974*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_210_son:70-666]]__
Okay…__
*107975*__
[[S:::1010-2078]]__
that was kinda sad.__
*107976*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_220_son:9-2596]]__
C’mon… I know we can do better than that!__
*107977*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_010_son:61-3091]]__
We did it! That was a little crazy…__
*107978*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_020_son:0-1314]]__
Hey, look at us!__
*107979*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_030_son:160-2110]]__
Did we win? We won!__
*107980*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_040_son:47-2211]]__
Whew! We actually did it!__
*107981*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_050_son:100-640]]__
Haha…__
*107982*__
[[S:::1220-1950]]__
YES!__
*107983*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_060_son:30-880]]__
All right!__
*107984*__
[[S:::1620-2790]]__
Glad we could get through that.__
*107985*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_070_son:20-520]]__
Ha…__
*107986*__
[[S:::1100-2380]]__
gets a little easier every time.__
*107987*__
[[S:::3030-3500]]__
Right…?__
*107988*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_080_son:40-1990]]__
Wow… that was fun!__
*107989*__
[[S:::2557-3200]]__
And hard…__
*107990*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s045_090_mmr:390-1750]]__
Whew–nicely done!__
*107991*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s045_100_mmr:290-1750]]__
Most impressive, brothers…!__
*107992*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s045_110_mmr:12-3780]]__
That was outstanding! Wish I had a better view.__
*107993*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s045_120_mmr:30-500]]__
Well!__
*107994*__
[[S:::710-2900]]__
I think you’ve gotten pretty good at THAT.__
*107995*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_130_son:124-1518]]__
And look – there’s loot!__
*107996*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s045_140_mmr:45-5229]]__
Wouldn’t it be nice to find some incense, just once? The smell of brimstone gets old quickly…__
*107997*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_150_son:90-2668]]__
Whoo! Alright…! Treasure time…__
*107998*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s045_160_mmr:45-5229]]__
Wouldn’t it be nice to find some incense, just once? The smell of brimstone gets old quickly…__
*107999*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_170_son:8-4631]]__
The sword’s back! He’s saying we’re free to go… but if we want to train further,__
*108000*__
[[S:::5053-6386]]__
there’s one more challenge here.__
*108001*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_172_son:0-1890]]__
One more challenge and they’ll open the gate forward.__
*108002*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_173_son:0-1180]]__
One more round to open the gate,__
*108003*__
[[S:::2110-3004]]__
or are we done for now?__
*108004*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_174_son:2-3528]]__
Guess we haven’t opened the way forward yet. One more challenge?__
*108005*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_175_son:7-2191]]__
Think we’re ready to do one more and get that gate open?__
*108006*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_176_son:9-3888]]__
Now both gates are down – we can go up to the next challenge if you want!__
*108007*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_180_son:45-1351]]__
Another gate opened up!__
*108008*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_190_son:41-1037]]__
There’s the way through!__
*108009*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_200_son:50-700]]__
Gate open!__
*108010*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_210_son:100-900]]__
I see the way up…!__
*108011*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s050_005_son:0-1170]]__
The voice is impressed…__
*108012*__
[[S:::1990-3860]]__
he says for anyone that can beat a Valkyrie,__
*108013*__
[[S:::4400-6140]]__
he’ll unlock a new level of challenges.__
*108014*__
[[S:::6580-8220]]__
I think all the swords just came back!__
*108015*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s050_010_son:60-2350]]__
All RIGHT! I think we mastered that one…__
*108016*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s050_020_son:51-5972]]__
That’s it… we beat them! We really beat them all. Think we’re ready for the next level?__
*108017*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s050_030_son:150-2510]]__
We did it! We beat every level of every test.__
*108018*__
[[S:::2900-4710]]__
I don’t think even Ragnarök could stop us now…!__
*108019*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s055_010_son:0-2140]]__
So… nobody lives here,__
*108020*__
[[S:::2720-3220]]__
do they?__
*108021*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s055_020_mmr:40-5441]]__
Only a fire giant could be at home here, and according to prophecy, we won’t see them again 'til Ragnarök.__
*108022*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s055_030_kra:50-1250]]__
We should explore further.__
*108023*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s055_040_son:30-2000]]__
My hands are so sweaty I can barely grip the bow…__
*108024*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s055_050_mmr:40-1250]]__
Well, my nose itches.__
*108025*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s055_060_kra:50-1500]]__
Wipe them before you fire.__
*108026*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s055_070_son:160-830]]__
I know…__
*108027*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s055_080_son:110-1341]]__
I keep breathing in ash…__
*108028*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s055_090_mmr:0-2000]]__
Imagine breathing it in from your throat-stump!__
*108029*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s055_100_son:32-1643]]__
Uh… I really can’t…__
*108030*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s055_110_kra:0-1000]]__
Do you feel sick?__
*108031*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s055_120_son:130-630]]__
No!__
*108032*__
[[S:::1180-1990]]__
No, it’s…__
*108033*__
[[S:::2710-3250]]__
just weird.__
*108034*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s055_130_son:70-2230]]__
I don’t usually get nervous when we climb…__
*108035*__
[[S:::3580-4380]]__
but don’t slip.__
*108036*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s055_140_mmr:0-1500]]__
I strongly concur.__
*108037*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s055_150_kra:0-750]]__
I will not.__
*108038*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s055_160_son:70-2210]]__
Okay, my eyes are really stinging now.__
*108039*__
[[S:::2940-4009]]__
And my throat burns.__
*108040*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s055_170_mmr:40-3000]]__
Well, it wouldn’t be a challenge without a little challenge, would it?__
*108041*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s055_180_kra:0-1580]]__
Weapons are honed by fire,__
*108042*__
[[S:::1980-2940]]__
not by comfort.__
*108043*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s055_190_son:60-2670]]__
If we could take this temperature and combine it with Helheim’s,__
*108044*__
[[S:::3260-4250]]__
it’d probably be perfect.__
*108045*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s055_200_mmr:70-2710]]__
And if the all-father had wings, he’d be a dragon.__
*108046*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s055_210_son:10-465]]__
Huh?__
*108047*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s055_210_son_a:9-390]]__
Huh?__
*108048*__
[[S::vo_lvl_clbq1_s900_010_son_stem:8900-16060]]__
That’s a Soul Eater! If that kills us, that’s it. No Valhalla. No Hel. No afterlife. Ever!__
*108049*__
[[S:::23330-23870]]__
Oh.__
*108050*__
[[S:::24870-26510]]__
Mom made them sound more dangerous than that.__
*108051*__
[[S::vo_lvl_clbq1_s900_010_kra_stem:18140-19110]]__
It does not attack.__
*108052*__
[[S:::28030-29710]]__
Then do not drop your guard.__
*108053*__
[[S:::30660-31250]]__
Come.__
*108054*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s002_010_brk:0-2500]]__
You rush around like that everywhere? Yeesh.__
*108055*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s002_020_brk:130-3000]]__
C’mere already! You’re gonna be real happy.__
*108056*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s002_030_son:30-605]]__
Wait—__
*108057*__
[[S:::1300-2339]]__
aren’t we talking to Brok?__
*108058*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s002_040_brk:26-819]]__
Catch!__
*108059*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s002_050_brk:0-5180]]__
Seeing as you’re my only customers, you need a quick way back to me with all your ill-gottens.__
*108060*__
[[S:::5600-6400]]__
Lookie…__
*108061*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s002_060_brk:0-1470]]__
The pile of rocks there—__
*108062*__
[[S:::2140-7950]]__
with that Key of Yggdrasil, you can open a magic door to the branches of the World Tree—__
*108063*__
[[S:::8340-10530]]__
a shortcut ’tween the realms.__
*108064*__
[[S:::11050-15170]]__
If y’ever see ’em out in the world, use it to get back to me quick.__
*108065*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s002_070_brk:0-959]]__
IGG-druh-sill__
*108066*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s002_080_brk:0-360]]__
But it’s__
*108067*__
[[S:::760-1450]]__
one-way__
*108068*__
[[S:::1800-5860]]__
only—straight back here and nowhere else. And whatever you do,__
*108069*__
[[S:::6270-14420]]__
never, never, EVER, never, ever, ever, ever, ever throw yourself over the edge of the path…__
*108070*__
[[S:::14820-16500]]__
lest you want death.__
*108071*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s002_090_son:50-550]]__
Yeah,__
*108072*__
[[S:::1220-2250]]__
I don’t see us wanting that.__
*108073*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s005_010_brk:0-670]]__
Good!__
*108074*__
[[S:::1020-3750]]__
Now when you’re done gawkin’, I got a favor to ask.__
*108075*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s007_010_brk:0-1500]]__
Got time fer a favor?__
*108076*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s007_020_brk:40-1250]]__
I’m not gonna beg ya.__
*108077*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s010_005_kra:80-1000]]__
What is it, Dwarf?__
*108078*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s010_010_brk:77-4417]]__
There’s this Alchemist, Andvari, been workin’ outta the Völunder Mines.__
*108079*__
[[S:::4659-9344]]__
Haven’t heard from him in mebbe, oh I dunno… a hundred winters or so?__
*108080*__
[[S:::9796-12827]]__
Probably dead, but uh, mebbe you can find him.__
*108081*__
[[S:::12934-16150]]__
He’s Dwarven like me. Wears a fancy green ring.__
*108082*__
[[S:::16303-18627]]__
Owes me a favor. You’ll look?__
*108083*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s010_020_kra:50-1170]]__
If it is on our path…__
*108084*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s010_030_brk:80-1860]]__
Oh I see how it is.__
*108085*__
[[S:::2280-4420]]__
Not a somethin’ fer nuthin’ type, are ya?__
*108086*__
[[S:::5030-5980]]__
Fine.__
*108087*__
[[S:::6400-9760]]__
If ya find Andvari, I’ll make him whip ya up somethin’ special.__
*108088*__
[[S:::10390-13250]]__
This entry stone here oughtta get you inside those mines.__
*108089*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s010_031_brk:0-4000]]__
The Völunder mines is northeast of the Temple, toward them ice shelves.__
*108090*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s010_032_brk:0-2810]]__
The Völunder Mines is right through these doors.__
*108091*__
[[S:::3320-6210]]__
Might as well have a look-see inside, don’tcha think?__
*108092*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s010_040_brk:70-3440]]__
I need that Alchemist for something I’m stewing up for you.__
*108093*__
[[S:::3900-5940]]__
If’n you’re smart, you’ll find him.__
*108094*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s010_050_brk:0-2750]]__
You scare up that Alchemist what needed finding?__
*108095*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s015_010_son:48-3836]]__
Uh… these runes read “Death inside”__
*108096*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s030_010_son:50-770]]__
So…__
*108097*__
[[S:::1190-3240]]__
Brok said his friend was Dwarven like him,__
*108098*__
[[S:::4140-5000]]__
wearing a green ring.__
*108099*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s030_020_kra:0-1000]]__
Look if you wish.__
*108100*__
[[S:::1420-3380]]__
I will be gathering resources for our journey.__
*108101*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s030_030_son:34-960]]__
You don’t want to help him?__
*108102*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s030_040_kra:0-500]]__
No.__
*108103*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s030_050_son:20-520]]__
Why not?__
*108104*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s030_060_kra:0-2200]]__
Because I do not run errands for Dwarves.__
*108105*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s030_070_son:46-528]]__
Oh.__
*108106*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s040_010_son:50-788]]__
Dwarven.__
*108107*__
[[S:::1123-1718]]__
But no ring.__
*108108*__
[[S:::2400-3274]]__
One of his crew?__
*108109*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s040_020_kra:0-1121]]__
Scorch marks—__
*108110*__
[[S:::1390-2750]]__
there along the floor and wall.__
*108111*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s040_030_son:0-557]]__
Weird.__
*108112*__
[[S:::1270-2250]]__
I guess we keep looking.__
*108113*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s040_031_kra:50-680]]__
We?__
*108114*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s040_032_son:40-670]]__
I mean__
*108115*__
[[S:::1240-2130]]__
I’LL keep looking.__
*108116*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s040_040_son:40-1000]]__
Soul Eater got him.__
*108117*__
[[S:::1860-3510]]__
Must have been part of that Alchemist’s crew.__
*108118*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s050_010_son:40-2160]]__
We should look at more of these bodies, right?__
*108119*__
[[S:::2830-4190]]__
Any of them could be Brok’s friend.__
*108120*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s050_020_kra:67-598]]__
Mmph.__
*108121*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s050_030_son:50-1500]]__
They probably have useful loot, too…__
*108122*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s060_010_kra:88-693]]__
Not him.__
*108123*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s060_020_son:30-500]]__
Hey,__
*108124*__
[[S:::1114-1800]]__
I thought you didn’t care.__
*108125*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s060_030_kra:30-2000]]__
I noticed the lack of ring while looting the body.__
*108126*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s060_040_son:30-250]]__
Oh.__
*108127*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s070_010_son:4-2330]]__
There’s the ring! On that severed hand!__
*108128*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s070_020_son:60-1750]]__
…attached to the Soul Eater.__
*108129*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s070_030_son:0-500]]__
Well,__
*108130*__
[[S:::1610-3100]]__
we know what happened to Andvari now;__
*108131*__
[[S:::4360-5510]]__
we can just go tell Brok.__
*108132*__
[[S:::6350-7400]]__
No need to fight it,__
*108133*__
[[S:::7850-8350]]__
right?__
*108134*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s070_040_kra:0-400]]__
No.__
*108135*__
[[S:::960-1660]]__
We will fight it.__
*108136*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s070_050_son:14-754]]__
But why?__
*108137*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s070_060_kra:40-1500]]__
Because you are frightened of it.__
*108138*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s080_010_son:45-2443]]__
He’s got both hands. This isn’t him.__
*108139*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s080_020_son:60-680]]__
No ring.__
*108140*__
[[S:::1480-3040]]__
We’re not gonna find Brok’s friend alive,__
*108141*__
[[S:::3480-3980]]__
are we…__
*108142*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s080_020_son_a:49-4066]]__
No ring. We’re not gonna find Brok’s friend alive, are we…__
*108143*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s080_030_son:42-1210]]__
It was a massacre…__
*108144*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s090_010_son:60-3200]]__
This is crazy! How are we supposed to kill something made of rock!?__
*108145*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s090_020_kra:30-1180]]__
Be strong, Atreus.__
*108146*__
[[S:::1650-3980]]__
Stay focused. And look for a weak point.__
*108147*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s090_030_son:2-508]]__
Yes, sir.__
*108148*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s100_009_kra:30-900]]__
Stay quiet.__
*108149*__
[[S:::1620-2750]]__
Make no sudden movement.__
*108150*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s100_010_son:50-570]]__
Look out!__
*108151*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s110_010_son:40-2190]]__
We did it! I can’t believe it.__
*108152*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s110_020_kra:50-760]]__
Believe it.__
*108153*__
[[S:::1340-3000]]__
You are stronger than you know.__
*108154*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s110_030_son:0-760]]__
Thank you, father.__
*108155*__
[[S:::1730-3000]]__
Let’s see if that’s the Alchemist’s ring.__
*108156*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s130_010_kra:0-610]]__
Green ring…__
*108157*__
[[S:::1410-2500]]__
Dwarvish inscription…__
*108158*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s130_020_son:30-920]]__
The Alchemist.__
*108159*__
[[S:::1460-2390]]__
But where’s the rest of him?__
*108160*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s130_030_kra:50-1250]]__
Ashes, most likely.__
*108161*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s130_040_son:70-990]]__
The Soul Eater got him…__
*108162*__
[[S:::2060-3500]]__
I guess we should bring this back to Brok.__
*108163*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s120_010_son:0-1300]]__
These Runes were written fast.__
*108164*__
[[S:::2600-3200]]__
It spells out:__
*108165*__
[[S:::4600-5730]]__
“Í Gimsteini.”__
*108166*__
[[S:::7100-8730]]__
Hmm… I don’t know that one.__
*108167*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s120_020_kra:40-1000]]__
We will ask the blue one.__
*108168*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s120_030_son:52-1262]]__
So now you’re interested?__
*108169*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s120_040_kra:50-1500]]__
We found his Alchemist.__
*108170*__
[[S:::1960-3250]]__
A reward was promised.__
*108171*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_009_brk:38-1067]]__
What’d you find?__
*108172*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_020_kra:40-750]]__
Your Alchemist.__
*108173*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_030_brk:24-429]]__
Huh?__
*108174*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_040_son:57-3939]]__
I’m sorry, Brok. The hand is all we could find, still wearing the ring.__
*108175*__
[[S:::4811-9783]]__
There was a Soul Eater inside, and well… it must have burned away the rest of him.__
*108176*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_050_son:0-1310]]__
We think he left a message…__
*108177*__
[[S:::2200-5350]]__
does “Í Gimsteini” mean anything to you?__
*108178*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_060_brk:70-2800]]__
Mmm, can’t say it do.__
*108179*__
[[S:::3180-6400]]__
Andvari always did have a thing fer cryptic messages.__
*108180*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_070_brk:3-3210]]__
S’pose you’ll still be wantin’ some compensation, huh?__
*108181*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_080_kra:44-722]]__
Naturally.__
*108182*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_090_brk:40-1250]]__
“Naturally,” he says.__
*108183*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_091_brk:18-1524]]__
Mjonefr uxi…__
*108184*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_100_brk:0-2410]]__
I’ll take a closer look at this here ring.__
*108185*__
[[S:::2860-6440]]__
Maybe Andvari left a bit a magic inside ’fore he croaked.__
*108186*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_110_son:32-951]]__
Dwarves can do that?__
*108187*__
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_120_brk:50-4150]]__
Sure. Dwarves and magic jewels is like flies and pig lips.__
*108188*__
[[S:::4550-5500]]__
Supple ones.__
*108189*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_130_son:57-2615]]__
Ew. I’m not as interested as I thought.__
*108190*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s005_010_son:45-2207]]__
That’s an interesting gate… I wonder who built it?__
*108191*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s005_020_son:60-900]]__
These ruins again…__
*108192*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s005_030_son:27-2914]]__
Wow… It’s like there was an entire city under the water!__
*108193*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s005_040_mmr:0-2000]]__
Aye, lad. A forgotten city.__
*108194*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s005_050_son:33-747]]__
What was it called?__
*108195*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s005_060_mmr:120-670]]__
Erm, well…__
*108196*__
[[S:::1120-1750]]__
I forgot!__
*108197*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s005_070_son:0-960]]__
What happened to this city?__
*108198*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s005_080_mmr:81-1355]]__
I’m not entirely sure, lad.__
*108199*__
[[S:::1701-5431]]__
It was abandoned long before Jörmungandr came to town and flooded the place.__
*108200*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s005_090_son:0-2180]]__
Hmm… I wonder what it was like to live here.__
*108201*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s010_010_son:0-750]]__
What happened here?__
*108202*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s010_020_kra:0-500]]__
Shipwreck.__
*108203*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s010_030_son:0-620]]__
Well, yeah.__
*108204*__
[[S:::1100-2250]]__
I wonder why it crashed?__
*108205*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s010_040_son:110-950]]__
That ship again…__
*108206*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s010_050_son:0-2440]]__
Wow, there was another shipwreck under the water.__
*108207*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s010_060_son:0-1611]]__
I wonder what happened to this ship’s crew?__
*108208*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s015_010_son:0-2250]]__
That’s some statue. Who built it, ya think?__
*108209*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s015_020_kra:42-935]]__
I do not know.__
*108210*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s015_030_son:0-2000]]__
The snake he’s holding… The World Serpent?__
*108211*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s015_040_kra:0-500]]__
Too small.__
*108212*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s015_050_son:0-2750]]__
Yea but… Maybe Thor is just REALLY big?__
*108213*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s015_060_kra:30-1946]]__
Mmm… Unlikely.__
*108214*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s015_070_son:22-1276]]__
I still can’t believe he ate it.__
*108215*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s020_010_son:0-2250]]__
That dragon… It’s Baldur’s, isn’t it?__
*108216*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s020_020_kra:20-750]]__
…Yes.__
*108217*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s020_030_son:60-950]]__
And you brought it down.__
*108218*__
[[S:::1490-2000]]__
To save me?__
*108219*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s020_040_mmr:0-1250]]__
It was very heroic.__
*108220*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s020_050_son:34-1275]]__
Thank you, by the way.__
*108221*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s020_060_kra:0-500]]__
For what?__
*108222*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s020_070_son:0-840]]__
For saving me.__
*108223*__
[[S:::1800-5120]]__
I… I know I screwed things up, before Baldur grabbed me.__
*108224*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s020_080_kra:23-3865]]__
Hmph. You did. But… you are my son.__
*108225*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s025_010_son:40-1390]]__
Hey, that looks like a water wheel.__
*108226*__
[[S:::1860-2760]]__
Or, I guess…__
*108227*__
[[S:::3270-4190]]__
an UNDER-water wheel.__
*108228*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s025_020_kra:32-430]]__
Hmph.__
*108229*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s025_030_son:0-1160]]__
Did you just… laugh at that?__
*108230*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s025_040_kra:0-500]]__
No.__
*108231*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s025_050_son:40-704]]__
Are you sure?__
*108232*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s025_060_kra:70-620]]__
Yes.__
*108233*__
[[S:::1010-2000]]__
I do not laugh.__
*108234*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s025_070_son:43-770]]__
Don’t I know it.__
*108235*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s025_080_son:30-2180]]__
I bet the wheel could work if it wasn’t underwater.__
*108236*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s025_090_son:0-530]]__
Wow…__
*108237*__
[[S:::767-4539]]__
there’s two of them! And they’re HUGE! I wonder why they aren’t moving?__
*108238*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s030_010_son:100-660]]__
Wow…__
*108239*__
[[S:::1110-2750]]__
I’ve never seen a waterfall so big.__
*108240*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s030_020_son:60-860]]__
The waterfall…__
*108241*__
[[S:::1290-2250]]__
It sure is beautiful.__
*108242*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s030_030_son:0-2750]]__
This waterfall is even bigger now that the water’s dropped.__
*108243*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s030_040_son:80-2143]]__
The waterfall… still beautiful.__
*108244*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s035_010_son:25-821]]__
Massive…__
*108245*__
[[S:::1120-2673]]__
There must be a way to open this gate.__
*108246*__
[[S:::3140-3819]]__
Somehow.__
*108247*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s035_020_son:0-520]]__
That gate…__
*108248*__
[[S:::970-1810]]__
we should try to open it.__
*108249*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s035_030_kra:90-650]]__
Why?__
*108250*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s035_040_son:0-3310]]__
I mean… look at it! There’s gotta be something useful behind it.__
*108251*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s035_050_son:40-570]]__
That gate…__
*108252*__
[[S:::950-1950]]__
we never did open it.__
*108253*__
[[S:::2380-3150]]__
Should we give it a try?__
*108254*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s035_060_kra:52-771]]__
Hmpgh.__
*108255*__
[[S::vo_lvl_sindri1_s910_010_son_stem:1209-3348]]__
We’re looking for a whetstone. Have you seen it?__
*108256*__
[[S:::10087-10798]]__
What?__
*108257*__
[[S:::22572-24188]]__
He killed his own father?__
*108258*__
[[S::vo_lvl_sindri1_s910_010_rvs_stem:3429-5931]]__
Aye. There was one in this room.__
*108259*__
[[S:::6220-10085]]__
My son sharpened his dagger on it, right before stabbing me in the back.__
*108260*__
[[S:::11090-14483]]__
Little bastard thought it was his turn to lead my crew.__
*108261*__
[[S:::14840-16607]]__
I was hard on him, sure,__
*108262*__
[[S:::17543-19196]]__
(sighs). Guess I shouldn’t be surprised.__
*108263*__
[[S:::19651-22237]]__
I did the same thing to my dad when I was his age.__
*108264*__
[[S:::28677-34656]]__
Ha! He may be a bastard, but he’s MY bastard. You’ll get no help from me, fool.__
*108265*__
[[S:::36857-39550]]__
Hey! That’s mine! HEY!__
*108266*__
[[S::vo_lvl_sindri1_s910_010_kra_stem:27520-28960]]__
Where is he now?__
*108267*__
[[S:::35100-36980]]__
Then his dagger will help.__
*108268*__
[[S:::39800-40400]]__
Come boy,__
*108269*__
[[S:::40940-42226]]__
we are leaving.__
*108270*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s005_010_sin:50-2500]]__
You boys look like you’re gearing up for quite the journey…__
*108271*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s007_010_sin:0-3250]]__
I know of a place that may contain some useful treasure.__
*108272*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s007_020_sin:72-1500]]__
Any interest in checking it out?__
*108273*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s010_010_sin:0-4857]]__
There’s an abandoned temple in Midgard \nthat a fellow Dwarf converted to his personal storeroom.__
*108274*__
[[S:::5420-9327]]__
Packed it with all sorts of treasures he collected during his travels throughout the realms.__
*108275*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s010_020_son:0-780]]__
Throughout the realms?__
*108276*__
[[S:::1390-2290]]__
Which ones did he go to?__
*108277*__
[[S:::2820-3630]]__
What did he collect?__
*108278*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s010_020_son_a:0-770]]__
Throughout the realms?__
*108279*__
[[S:::1430-2360]]__
Which ones did he go to?__
*108280*__
[[S:::3020-3750]]__
What did he collect?__
*108281*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s010_030_sin:130-1030]]__
Fáfnir was a…__
*108282*__
[[S:::1650-7290]]__
shall we say, “aggressive” collector of magical artifacts. The more he acquired, the more he desired.__
*108283*__
[[S:::7790-10770]]__
There was no realm too dangerous, no relic too hazardous.__
*108284*__
[[S:::11270-14940]]__
He once ventured deep into Niflheim for a whetstone, of all things!__
*108285*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s010_040_sin:542-2860]]__
Huh. I bet that was quite the whetstone…__
*108286*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s010_050_kra:0-1854]]__
Does this story have a point?__
*108287*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s010_060_sin:20-1280]]__
Yes it does!__
*108288*__
[[S:::1840-5270]]__
I just happen to have an entry stone to Fáfnir’s Storeroom!__
*108289*__
[[S:::5710-7250]]__
You might find something useful in there.__
*108290*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s010_070_son:0-500]]__
Neat!__
*108291*__
[[S:::990-1610]]__
Thanks Sindri!__
*108292*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s010_080_sin:50-1060]]__
You’re very welcome!__
*108293*__
[[S:::1420-4850]]__
Oh, and uh… if you find that whetstone… well…__
*108294*__
[[S:::5330-7500]]__
It sure would be nice of you to bring it to me!__
*108295*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s020_010_sin:0-2550]]__
I’d advise caution if you’re heading to the storeroom.__
*108296*__
[[S:::2771-6551]]__
Last I was there, all manner of nastiness had taken up residence.__
*108297*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s020_010_sin_a:0-2990]]__
I’d advise caution if you’re heading into the storeroom.__
*108298*__
[[S:::3410-7910]]__
I was there over a century ago, and all manner of nastiness had taken up residence.__
*108299*__
[[S:::8330-11750]]__
Can’t imagine its become any cleaner after one hundred years of neglect.__
*108300*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s020_020_son:31-1846]]__
Won’t your friend be upset if we steal all his stuff?__
*108301*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s020_030_sin:50-2698]]__
Oh hahaha no, no not at all.__
*108302*__
[[S:::2698-4420]]__
He’s dead. I think.__
*108303*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s020_040_son:0-1210]]__
Oh… sorry.__
*108304*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s020_050_sin:50-1667]]__
No, no need to be sorry.__
*108305*__
[[S:::1858-7658]]__
These things happen when one travels from realm to realm, collecting priceless artifacts that don’t belong to you.__
*108306*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s025_010_son:0-1520]]__
Treasures from all the different realms…__
*108307*__
[[S:::2000-3750]]__
Do you think Fáfnir went to Alfheim too?__
*108308*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s025_020_kra:30-1000]]__
I do not know.__
*108309*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s025_030_son:1-2099]]__
Aren’t you curious? He sounds interesting.__
*108310*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s025_040_kra:0-3270]]__
We go to this storeroom to collect anything useful for our journey.__
*108311*__
[[S:::3790-5750]]__
Not to learn more about the Dwarf.__
*108312*__
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_sindri1_s025_050_mmr:0-2790]]__
Fáfnir WAS a rather interesting fellow, little brother.__
*108313*__
[[S:::3240-5000]]__
Perhaps I’ll tell you his story one day.__
*108314*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s030_010_kra:61-852]]__
Reavers.__
*108315*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s030_020_son:0-500]]__
Uh oh.__
*108316*__
[[S:::900-2100]]__
They must’ve gotten here first.__
*108317*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s032_010_kra:0-2000]]__
Locked. Find another entrance.__
*108318*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s035_010_son:25-624]]__
Whoah…__
*108319*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s037_010_son:0-1570]]__
Looks like the reavers made it inside.__
*108320*__
[[S:::2050-3450]]__
I hope they didn’t take all the treasure…__
*108321*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s037_020_kra:20-490]]__
Come.__
*108322*__
[[S:::1300-2250]]__
We will find out.__
*108323*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s040_010_son:0-1220]]__
Just some stupid pots.__
*108324*__
[[S:::1570-2150]]__
And draugr.__
*108325*__
[[S:::2680-4750]]__
No magical treasure, and no whetstone.__
*108326*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s040_020_kra:0-4000]]__
Keep your expectations low, boy, and you will never be disappointed.__
*108327*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s042_010_son:19-350]]__
Ahh!__
*108328*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s042_020_kra:50-1240]]__
They caught you off-guard.__
*108329*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s042_030_son:10-1022]]__
I wasn’t expecting them!__
*108330*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s042_040_kra:30-896]]__
Exactly.__
*108331*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s045_010_son:4-3059]]__
There’s nothing but poison in this one. And a stupid bird statue.__
*108332*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s045_020_kra:100-3730]]__
AND useful resources; the main reason we are here, boy.__
*108333*__
[[S:::4360-4950]]__
However…__
*108334*__
[[S:::5620-7250]]__
many of these chests have been emptied.__
*108335*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s045_030_son:740-1860]]__
Probably by the Reavers…__
*108336*__
[[S:::2390-3800]]__
I hope they didn’t take Sindri’s whetstone.__
*108337*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s050_010_son:1-3655]]__
I have a good feeling about this next one. Maybe we’ll even find the whetstone!__
*108338*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s050_020_kra:30-2750]]__
Remember what I told you about expectations, boy.__
*108339*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s050_030_son:0-1350]]__
“Keep them low,” I remember.__
*108340*__
[[S:::1860-3000]]__
Still. Good feeling!__
*108341*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s050_040_son:0-1000]]__
So much for my good feeling.__
*108342*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s050_050_kra:47-801]]__
Mmm-hmm.__
*108343*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s050_060_son:0-500]]__
I know…__
*108344*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s052_010_son:120-1250]]__
I was ready for them, this time.__
*108345*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s052_010_son_a:550-1750]]__
I was ready for them, this time.__
*108346*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s052_020_kra:50-826]]__
I saw.__
*108347*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s052_030_son:40-2200]]__
So I should keep my expectations low,__
*108348*__
[[S:::2800-4000]]__
but always expect an attack?__
*108349*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s052_040_kra:51-7584]]__
It is a delicate balance. Expect the worst. Assume nothing. And always anticipate an attack.__
*108350*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s052_050_son:50-1250]]__
Sure is a lot to remember.__
*108351*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s055_010_son:520-1600]]__
Still no whetstone.__
*108352*__
[[S:::2390-3650]]__
And only one room left.__
*108353*__
[[S:::4660-5930]]__
I know I shouldn’t hope, but…__
*108354*__
[[S:::6920-7930]]__
do you think we’ll find it there?__
*108355*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s055_020_kra:80-675]]__
No.__
*108356*__
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s063_010_rvs:140-3250]]__
So, you back to piss on my corpse? You ungrateful little –__
*108357*__
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s063_020_rvs:350-2350]]__
Eh? Who are you two?__
*108358*__
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s063_030_rvs:150-1960]]__
Fine, piss off then!__
*108359*__
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s063_040_rvs:98-4422]]__
Hmph, you’re back. Well what do you lot want?__
*108360*__
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s064_010_rvs:120-700]]__
Ha!__
*108361*__
[[S:::1160-2000]]__
Choke on it!__
*108362*__
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s064_020_rvs:100-5655]]__
Hmph. For a pair of pasty fífls, you sure can fight. I’ll give ya that.__
*108363*__
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s064_030_rvs:250-1466]]__
What are you looking at?__
*108364*__
[[S:::1600-6029]]__
Begone with yeh, or I’ll rip your legs off from beyond the grave, you dirty bastards.__
*108365*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s065_010_son:0-6450]]__
Why would his son betray him like that? Kill his own father? Over some treasure? It seems so greedy.__
*108366*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s065_020_kra:160-1540]]__
Remember what I told you, boy.__
*108367*__
[[S:::2670-3500]]__
Assume nothing.__
*108368*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s065_030_son:0-3466]]__
Well—sure, he didn’t seem like a great father. But…__
*108369*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s065_040_kra:71-1847]]__
You only know half the story.__
*108370*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s065_050_son:38-590]]__
I guess…__
*108371*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s072_010_sin:60-2000]]__
Have you made it out to Fáfnir’s Storeroom yet?__
*108372*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s072_020_sin:70-3750]]__
Poor Fáfnir… There’s a fine line between ambition and greed, you know.__
*108373*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s072_030_sin:160-3150]]__
Found anything good in Fáfnir’s storeroom? Like, maybe…__
*108374*__
[[S:::3520-4250]]__
a whetstone?__
*108375*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s072_040_sin:60-2380]]__
Just make sure you watch each other’s backs in the storeroom.__
*108376*__
[[S:::2870-4750]]__
Wouldn’t want to lose my loyal customers!__
*108377*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s075_005_sin:100-2670]]__
Well, what did you think of Fáfnir’s Storeroom?__
*108378*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s075_006_sin:46-3342]]__
You, uh… didn’t happen to find that whetstone, perchance?__
*108379*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s075_010_kra:0-1340]]__
We found no whetstone.__
*108380*__
[[S:::1890-4000]]__
This dagger belongs to the Reaver who took it.__
*108381*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s075_020_sin:20-1490]]__
This sigil looks familiar…__
*108382*__
[[S:::2140-4000]]__
Maybe I can figure out which clan it’s from?__
*108383*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s075_030_son:28-1639]]__
They took most of the good stuff.__
*108384*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s075_040_sin:70-570]]__
Oh?__
*108385*__
[[S:::880-3480]]__
Well… Here, take this. In exchange for the dagger.__
*108386*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s080_010_sin:50-6210]]__
The dagger you brought me is quite interesting. An artless design, but the construction is sound.__
*108387*__
[[S:::6670-8420]]__
Where in the temple did you find this?__
*108388*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s080_020_son:23-933]]__
In a Reaver’s back.__
*108389*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s080_030_sin:108-2319]]__
Ugh… Uuuughhhh…__
*108390*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s080_040_son:20-1690]]__
He mentioned he was part of a larger clan.__
*108391*__
[[S:::2300-3410]]__
Maybe they took the whetstone?__
*108392*__
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s080_050_sin:60-1210]]__
Quite possibly.__
*108393*__
[[S:::2280-4250]]__
I know I’ve seen this design before…__
*108394*__
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s095_010_rvs:360-5000]]__
What are you fools doing back here? Come to pilfer my boots and small clothes?__
*108395*__
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s095_020_rvs:510-3900]]__
I swear if I weren’t a ghost, I’d rip yer heart out through yer throat.__
*108396*__
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s095_030_rvs:230-1990]]__
Are you just standing there to taunt me?__
*108397*__
[[S:::2350-3250]]__
Begone with ye!__
*108398*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s100_010_son:80-970]]__
We found your son.__
*108399*__
[[S:::1790-2290]]__
He…__
*108400*__
[[S:::3460-4450]]__
he was betrayed, too.__
*108401*__
[[S:::5570-6760]]__
And we found part of his journal.__
*108402*__
[[S:::7860-9500]]__
It sounded like he regretted killing you.__
*108403*__
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s100_020_rvs:34-3178]]__
Hmph. Fat lot of good that does me.__
*108404*__
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s100_030_rvs:170-1010]]__
How’d he go out?__
*108405*__
[[S:::1850-2500]]__
He die fighting?__
*108406*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s100_040_kra:50-3250]]__
We found four corpses near his. They were decapitated.__
*108407*__
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s100_050_rvs:455-1080]]__
Ha!__
*108408*__
[[S:::1080-3730]]__
Vandrid always did keep his sword nice and sharp…__
*108409*__
[[S:::4620-6000]]__
A lesson he picked up from me.__
*108410*__
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s100_060_rvs:1050-2820]]__
He’s a backstabbing bastard, but…__
*108411*__
[[S:::3900-5940]]__
knowin’ he’s in Valhalla sets me at ease.__
*108412*__
[[S:::6930-7450]]__
Thanks.__
*108413*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s100_070_son:40-1050]]__
We did a good thing!__
*108414*__
[[S:::1730-2850]]__
I’m glad we came back here.__
*108415*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s100_080_kra:140-2440]]__
That thief did not deserve the peace you gave him.__
*108416*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s100_090_son:60-670]]__
Maybe so.__
*108417*__
[[S:::1380-1850]]__
Still,__
*108418*__
[[S:::2590-3660]]__
it feels good to help people.__
*108419*__
[[S:::4380-5070]]__
Even the dead ones.__
*108420*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s100_080_kra_a:0-2220]]__
That thief did not deserve the peace you gave him.__
*108421*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s100_100_kra:51-2227]]__
Hmm. So much like your mother…__
*108422*__
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s005_005_trsp:72-1327]]__
They’re all gone….__
*108423*__
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s005_010_trsp:50-780]]__
Bjorn…__
*108424*__
[[S:::2030-2560]]__
Iarl…__
*108425*__
[[S:::4260-5090]]__
Vifil…__
*108426*__
[[S:::6520-7460]]__
Hjorvarth…__
*108427*__
[[S:::9290-10000]]__
Grimwald…__
*108428*__
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s010_010_trsp:30-740]]__
Johan…__
*108429*__
[[S:::2600-3530]]__
Thorvid…__
*108430*__
[[S:::5330-6170]]__
Hallveig…__
*108431*__
[[S:::7330-8000]]__
Solmund…__
*108432*__
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s010_020_trsp:20-974]]__
Bothvar…__
*108433*__
[[S:::1670-2420]]__
Frømund…__
*108434*__
[[S:::3920-4700]]__
Eric…__
*108435*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s015_010_kra:40-1000]]__
What does it say, boy?__
*108436*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s015_020_son:35-6480]]__
Hmm… It doesn’t say anything, really. I think it’s more a symbol. Or maybe a brand.__
*108437*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s015_020_son_a:39-6879]]__
Hmm… It doesn’t say anything, really. I think it’s more a symbol. Or maybe a brand.__
*108438*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s015_030_kra:40-1670]]__
It must belong to the captain.__
*108439*__
[[S:::2180-3500]]__
Keep watch for these in the lake.__
*108440*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s020_010_son:340-1000]]__
Are you okay?__
*108441*__
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s020_020_trsp:180-990]]__
No, son.__
*108442*__
[[S:::2950-3760]]__
My goods__
*108443*__
[[S:::4310-5360]]__
are underwater.__
*108444*__
[[S:::6690-11310]]__
My men are drowned. And yet, their bodies continue to walk the beaches.__
*108445*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s020_030_kra:40-1090]]__
Hel-Walkers.__
*108446*__
[[S:::1800-3000]]__
They plague these lands.__
*108447*__
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s020_040_trsp:150-1240]]__
I was their captain.__
*108448*__
[[S:::2730-4890]]__
They died because of me.__
*108449*__
[[S:::7010-10200]]__
But these abominations sully their memories.__
*108450*__
[[S:::11740-15530]]__
I will find a way to free them from their tortured state.__
*108451*__
[[S:::15530-18080]]__
In this, I am determined.__
*108452*__
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s025_010_trsp:0-3510]]__
A thunderstorm scattered all three of my ships across the lake.__
*108453*__
[[S:::5030-7240]]__
I know not what I did to anger Thor…__
*108454*__
[[S:::8500-10190]]__
but his judgement was swift__
*108455*__
[[S:::10650-11190]]__
and brutal.__
*108456*__
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s030_010_trsp:0-3247]]__
I discovered opportunities for hunting and trade in these lands.__
*108457*__
[[S:::3476-6062]]__
I gave up my search for Jötunheim long ago…__
*108458*__
[[S:::6992-9346]]__
Leave that for the younger, more hopeful men.__
*108459*__
[[S:::10885-12641]]__
But I was over-eager…__
*108460*__
[[S:::14085-16247]]__
and my men paid a heavy price.__
*108461*__
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s030_020_trsp:210-3089]]__
I felt blessed to lead such a loyal crew.__
*108462*__
[[S:::4489-6533]]__
We’d become a family over the years.__
*108463*__
[[S:::7540-8229]]__
And now…__
*108464*__
[[S:::9210-11496]]__
my family is cursed.__

[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s030_030_trsp:40-1270]]__
I will not give up__
*108466*__
[[S:::1770-3250]]__
until they are put to rest.__
*108467*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s035_010_son:270-710]]__
Boy,__
*108468*__
[[S:::1740-2500]]__
what a sad story.__
*108469*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s035_020_kra:130-1040]]__
…Yes.__
*108470*__
[[S:::1990-2920]]__
We should help him.__
*108471*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s035_030_son:70-600]]__
Really?__
*108472*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s035_040_kra:40-1000]]__
You are surprised.__
*108473*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s035_050_son:0-400]]__
Well,__
*108474*__
[[S:::1220-1770]]__
yeah.__
*108475*__
[[S:::2730-4396]]__
I didn’t think you’d care about helping a spirit.__
*108476*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s035_060_kra:90-2400]]__
Fighting more Hel-Walkers is good experience for you.__
*108477*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s035_070_son:31-614]]__
Oh.__
*108478*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s040_010_son:670-2372]]__
Were all those guys part of his crew?__
*108479*__
[[S:::3055-4280]]__
That’s a tough crew.__
*108480*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s040_020_kra:100-2040]]__
And all were his responsibility.__
*108481*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s040_030_son:35-1909]]__
That’s a lot of responsibility.__
*108482*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s040_040_kra:0-1109]]__
Does it frighten you?__
*108483*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s040_050_son:40-539]]__
Uh…?__
*108484*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s040_060_kra:50-1168]]__
Responsibility.__
*108485*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s040_070_son:120-1700]]__
Oh. Uh, no.__
*108486*__
[[S:::2130-2850]]__
I don’t think so.__
*108487*__
[[S:::3530-4022]]__
I mean,__
*108488*__
[[S:::4350-5373]]__
I think it used to.__
*108489*__
[[S:::5850-6890]]__
But not as much anymore.__
*108490*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s040_080_kra:60-797]]__
Why is that?__
*108491*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s040_090_son:0-500]]__
Well,__
*108492*__
[[S:::870-1810]]__
being out here…__
*108493*__
[[S:::2470-2982]]__
with you…__
*108494*__
[[S:::3980-5150]]__
It makes me feel more grown up.__
*108495*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s040_100_kra:44-605]]__
Hmm.__
*108496*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s045_010_son:1226-2080]]__
Seriously,__
*108497*__
[[S:::2770-4897]]__
how did this one captain lead so many men?__
*108498*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s045_020_kra:60-1165]]__
He had their loyalty.__
*108499*__
[[S:::1420-2380]]__
So they followed.__
*108500*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s045_030_son:398-1606]]__
And then they all died.__
*108501*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s045_040_son:25-1351]]__
He must’ve been a bad leader.__
*108502*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s045_050_kra:40-1170]]__
Why do you think that?__
*108503*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s045_060_son:0-484]]__
Well…__
*108504*__
[[S:::840-2443]]__
he led all of these men to their deaths.__
*108505*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s045_070_kra:0-520]]__
True.__
*108506*__
[[S:::1150-2829]]__
But these men chose to follow.__
*108507*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s045_080_son:22-965]]__
Hmm…__
*108508*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s045_090_kra:45-2193]]__
Even good leaders make poor choices.__
*108509*__
[[S:::2415-4529]]__
The best take responsibility for them.__
*108510*__
[[S:::5246-6079]]__
Remember this.__
*108511*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s050_010_son:100-720]]__
Father,__
*108512*__
[[S:::1850-3163]]__
were you ever a leader?__
*108513*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s050_020_kra:34-707]]__
I…__
*108514*__
[[S:::1573-3079]]__
Many years ago. Yes.__
*108515*__
[[S:::3660-5009]]__
I led men in battle.__
*108516*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s050_030_son:50-1665]]__
Were you a good leader?__
*108517*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s050_040_kra:229-1118]]__
It is…__
*108518*__
[[S:::1428-2330]]__
complicated.__
*108519*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s050_050_son:30-670]]__
Did you ever—__
*108520*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s050_060_kra:0-1406]]__
No more questions, boy.__
*108521*__
[[S:::1830-3246]]__
Focus on the task at hand.__
*108522*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s050_070_son:0-500]]__
Yes, sir.__
*108523*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s055_010_son:42-5553]]__
Phew. That was the last ship. I hope the captain will be satisfied now.__
*108524*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s055_020_kra:0-750]]__
Unlikely.__
*108525*__
[[S:::1320-4000]]__
He was determined to put these men to rest himself.__
*108526*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s055_030_son:0-519]]__
But…__
*108527*__
[[S:::780-2142]]__
He would’ve never been able to.__
*108528*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s055_040_kra:90-1450]]__
That does not matter to him.__
*108529*__
[[S:::2040-4575]]__
Our victory will only remind him of his failure.__
*108530*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s055_050_son:130-669]]__
Then…__
*108531*__
[[S:::1680-2690]]__
why do we do this?__
*108532*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s060_010_son:30-550]]__
Father,__
*108533*__
[[S:::1920-3500]]__
why did you really want to help this spirit?__
*108534*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s060_020_kra:40-1428]]__
You need the experience.__
*108535*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s060_030_son:80-2420]]__
I’ve had plenty of experience fighting these things!__
*108536*__
[[S:::3490-4500]]__
What’s the real reason?__
*108537*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s060_040_kra:47-865]]__
Hmm…__
*108538*__
[[S:::1213-3042]]__
this man inspired loyalty.__
*108539*__
[[S:::3492-5662]]__
He took responsibility for his mistakes.__
*108540*__
[[S:::5909-7603]]__
And he was determined to fix them.__
*108541*__
[[S:::8145-9356]]__
These are good lessons for you.__
*108542*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s060_050_son:15-318]]__
Oh.__
*108543*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s060_060_kra:36-572]]__
Hmph.__
*108544*__
[[S:::865-1569]]__
Yes.__
*108545*__
[[S:::2166-2645]]__
“Oh.”__
*108546*__
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s065_010_trsp:0-1820]]__
My…my men are…__
*108547*__
[[S:::2870-4500]]__
They roam no longer?__
*108548*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s070_010_son:50-750]]__
That’s right!__
*108549*__
[[S:::1270-1833]]__
We kille—__
*108550*__
[[S:::2150-2558]]__
uh…__
*108551*__
[[S:::4140-5705]]__
we laid them all to rest.__
*108552*__
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s070_020_trsp:120-830]]__
I see…__
*108553*__
[[S:::2110-3501]]__
So even in death,__
*108554*__
[[S:::4060-5208]]__
I am a failure.__
*108555*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s070_030_kra:70-1845]]__
But in life, you were honorable.__
*108556*__
[[S:::2350-3260]]__
Strong-willed.__
*108557*__
[[S:::3750-5265]]__
And you inspired loyalty.__
*108558*__
[[S:::6178-7455]]__
These are good qualities.__
*108559*__
[[S:::8250-9027]]__
Aren’t they, boy?__
*108560*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s070_040_son:29-581]]__
Yeah.__
*108561*__
[[S:::1510-3556]]__
I couldn’t believe how many men followed you here!__
*108562*__
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s070_050_trsp:57-590]]__
I…__
*108563*__
[[S:::1370-3320]]__
Thank you for your kind words.__
*108564*__
[[S:::4780-7060]]__
May your journey have a more pleasant end__

than mine.__
*108566*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s075_010_son:40-579]]__
Well,__
*108567*__
[[S:::1375-2026]]__
you're right.__
*108568*__
[[S:::3102-4490]]__
He didn’t seem very satisfied.__
*108569*__
[[S:::6051-8660]]__
I guess you never really get over losing the ones you care about.__
*108570*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s075_020_kra:52-747]]__
Hmmph.__
*108571*__
[[S:::1152-1690]]__
Never.__
*108572*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s075_020_kra_a:0-590]]__
No.__
*108573*__
[[S:::1140-1670]]__
Never.__
*108574*__
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s005_010_spvl:0-863]]__
Gullveig…__
*108575*__
[[S:::2916-5309]]__
You were taken from this realm too early.__
*108576*__
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s010_010_spvl:560-2120]]__
You will be whole again…__
*108577*__
[[S:::2820-3850]]__
This I swear.__
*108578*__
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s010_020_spvl:40-1280]]__
Midgard suffers…__
*108579*__
[[S:::2130-4500]]__
deprived of your power, my dear Gullveig…__
*108580*__
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s010_030_spvl:14-2381]]__
I will not rest until you are complete!__
*108581*__
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s015_010_spvl:40-1960]]__
You, who walks among the living!__
*108582*__
[[S:::2560-4610]]__
My beloved Gullveig calls to me…__
*108583*__
[[S:::5070-6650]]__
she yearns for peace!__
*108584*__
[[S:::7260-9390]]__
Yet her remains lie in pieces.__
*108585*__
[[S:::9940-13000]]__
I beg of you, make my Gullveig whole again!__
*108586*__
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s015_010_spvl_a:180-2010]]__
You, who walks among the living!__
*108587*__
[[S:::2510-4620]]__
My beloved Gullveig calls to me…__
*108588*__
[[S:::5150-7160]]__
I can hear her scattered bones.__
*108589*__
[[S:::7650-9370]]__
They sing with anguish!__
*108590*__
[[S:::10240-10990]]__
I beg of you,__
*108591*__
[[S:::11620-13250]]__
make my Gullveig whole again!__
*108592*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s015_020_son:200-1820]]__
You want us to collect her bones?__
*108593*__
[[S:::2600-3000]]__
Gross.__
*108594*__
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s015_030_spvl:60-2900]]__
Gullveig’s seiðr magic knows no bounds.__
*108595*__
[[S:::3480-5750]]__
She can reunite you with those you’ve lost!__
*108596*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s015_040_son:0-501]]__
Really?__
*108597*__
[[S:::1070-1655]]__
How?__
*108598*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s015_050_kra:46-826]]__
Boy…__
*108599*__
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s015_060_spvl:170-1930]]__
I can smell your grief, child.__
*108600*__
[[S:::2720-7990]]__
Rest assured, her magic is strong enough to create bridges between life and death…__
*108601*__
[[S:::8510-10000]]__
if only for a short while.__
*108602*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s015_070_kra:70-570]]__
Boy!__
*108603*__
[[S:::840-1500]]__
We are leaving.__
*108604*__
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s020_010_spvl:110-4500]]__
They’ve taken three of sweet Gullveig’s bones, and spread them across the lake.__
*108605*__
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s020_020_spvl:40-3250]]__
Bring me her bones, child! Gullveig will reward you!__
*108606*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s025_010_son:50-690]]__
Father…__
*108607*__
[[S:::1700-3500]]__
maybe we should look for those bones?__
*108608*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s025_020_kra:0-488]]__
Why.__
*108609*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s025_030_son:137-855]]__
Didn’t you hear him?__
*108610*__
[[S:::1552-4677]]__
We could talk to Mom again. If we keep an eye out while we—__
*108611*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s025_040_kra:40-1330]]__
Look if you wish, boy!__
*108612*__
[[S:::1790-4000]]__
I will not be distracted by this fool’s errand.__
*108613*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s027_010_son:30-720]]__
Do you hear that?__
*108614*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s027_020_son:24-938]]__
What is that sound?__
*108615*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s027_030_son:80-580]]__
Is that…__
*108616*__
[[S:::940-1575]]__
singing?__
*108617*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s027_040_son:29-1426]]__
That sounds like one of her bones!__
*108618*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s027_050_son:30-1400]]__
I think I hear a bone nearby…__
*108619*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s027_060_son:0-1000]]__
You hear that too, right?__
*108620*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s027_070_son:30-1000]]__
I hear a bone singing!__
*108621*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s030_010_kra:44-1749]]__
These bones pulse with magic…__
*108622*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s030_020_son:46-1293]]__
It must be Gullveig!__
*108623*__
[[S:::1954-2485]]__
Could we…__
*108624*__
[[S:::3432-4500]]__
could we just hold onto it?__
*108625*__
[[S:::5388-6511]]__
Maybe we’ll find the rest of them.__
*108626*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s030_030_kra:0-1250]]__
This Spirit lies to you, boy.__
*108627*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s030_040_son:0-700]]__
How would you know?__
*108628*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s030_050_kra:0-1550]]__
I have known many spirits.__
*108629*__
[[S:::2010-3250]]__
They are all liars.__
*108630*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s030_060_son:0-830]]__
This one is different.__
*108631*__
[[S:::1200-1700]]__
I know it.__
*108632*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s030_070_kra:20-1250]]__
You “know” very little.__
*108633*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s032_010_kra:90-3335]]__
Trusting a spirit to keep its word is foolish, boy.__
*108634*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s032_020_son:7-503]]__
But,__
*108635*__
[[S:::955-2340]]__
if there’s even a chance…__
*108636*__
[[S:::3110-4154]]__
Don’t you want to see mom again?__
*108637*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s032_030_kra:0-150]]__
Boy…__
*108638*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s032_040_son:48-1211]]__
Guess it’s just me…__
*108639*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s032_050_kra:39-1017]]__
Of course I—__
*108640*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s032_060_kra:0-2030]]__
She is gone, Atreus.__
*108641*__
[[S:::2720-4000]]__

Father!__

[[S:WARRIOR SPIRIT 2:vo_lvl_xplubobmb_s020_040_wsp2:0-2510]]__
My brother and I possess powerful talismans.__
*108826*__

If you tell him for me, you can have mine.__

My brother and I possess powerful talismans.__

If you tell him for me, you can have mine.__
*108830*__

Please… Find him!__
*108835*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubobmb_s025_010_son:0-3389]]__
His brother must be that spirit we saw spouting nonsense earlier.__
*108836*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubobmb_s025_020_son:0-2000]]__
Why don’t we just help him for free?__
*108837*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubobmb_s025_030_kra:0-1550]]__
His task is a distraction.__
*108838*__
[[S:::2150-6250]]__
If the reward helps us on our journey, then it is fair trade for our effort.__
*108839*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubobmb_s025_040_son:7-354]]__
Yeah.__
*108840*__

boy.__

And it’s not like he can use it anymore…__
*108843*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubobmb_s030_010_son:9-3987]]__
Maybe it’s better he doesn’t know the truth. What if he doesn’t take it well?__
*108844*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubobmb_s030_020_kra:0-1270]]__
Anticipate the worst.__
*108845*__
[[S:::1890-2250]]__
Always.__
*108846*__
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubobmb_s030_030_son:30-2000]]__
Then I’ll just be miserable all the time.__
*108847*__
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubobmb_s030_040_kra:0-1000]]__
But ready for the worst.__

I wait alone for what?
